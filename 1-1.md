### Why questions? And what gets in the way?

Before we embark on our journey, there are a couple things that seem useful and fairly important to discuss briefly:

#1 - So far, we've talked a lot about questioning things. But is this even a good thing? Why not just "go with the flow"? Is it important to know what's important, "true"? What if we're 100% right, or even just "mostly" right about everything already - wouldn't that be a relative waste of our time and attention? Wouldn't our efforts be better spent elsewhere - like on taking action and on living our answers?

All good questions! Let's take the first couple first... Is questioning things a good thing? Is knowing what's important... important?

Well, I could say something along the lines of, "Of course, dear fellow! Lest we be ignorant and wander about aimlessly"... But couldn't ignorant ambling be a good thing, too? The point is that, ultimately, I don't know - and I don't think you _can_ know until you start thinking about what's important / true (i.e. asking questions), and even then, you're probably on shaky, circular ground. So perhaps it's not important. Perhaps it is. Either way, at least for me personally (and I'm guessing that, if you've read this far, you're probably similar), I seem to have a tendency for curiosity, to observe and ask questions and learn and discover my blindspots, to try and make sense of things and find meaning. I can partly ignore or suppress this "drive", but that doesn't make it go away<sup>0.775</sup>... it's still there. It seems that most humans share this drive to some extent. 

I also think (and I'll discuss this more later), that this drive may ultimately be a necessary-but-temporary stepping stone to be "transcended-and-included", that perhaps there is no "meaning of life" in the way we tend to think of it, and that there is a lot of benefit to be had in "letting go" and just "being" - even in the midst of our doing.

And this begins to answer the last couple questions above, too... Let me be clear that, although the emphasis so far has been on asking more questions, I think answers, and acting on those answers, is at least as important (see the bolded "purpose of this site" above). Rather than a continuous questioning (where nothing ever gets done), or continuous action (where the more "important" things rarely get done), I'd suggest an intuitive<sup>0.8</sup> balance between the two is most useful - quality action, periodically interspersed with questioning and re-evaluating our direction; moving forwards, and course correcting.

Again, ultimately, I think we can approach a kind of synthesis of the two - where the boundary between question, answer, and action, between uncertainty, certainty, and expression, becomes so fluid and immediate that it seems to blur and fade altogether - where we act with such "presence" that it's completely without doubt, and yet simultaneously there's an unconscious, continuous uptake and processing of data to re-evaluate the situation - and all while we remain completely open and ready to do a complete 180 at any moment<sup>0.85</sup>. I think, however, that it's a process, and we probably don't start there. We start by asking questions, coming up with some answers, and testing those answers with action.

Finally, I'll add that the reason I'm emphasizing questions initially is because it seems to be relatively lacking today. We have lots of answers, and lots of action, but much less uncertainty and question-asking. We too often turn away from that intuitive sense of unease that wants us to examine it and put ourselves on the "right" path again. If we play this out on an individual level over the course of years, or even decades, we find that we've lived a life that hasn't been true to ourselves and has been relatively devoid of "meaning" - at which point we're consumed by a mid-life crisis, or worse, deathbed regrets<sup>0.9</sup>. If we play this out on a collective level over the course of a generation or two, we find ourselves with too much power and intelligence, and not enough wisdom or flexibility to guide it. So I think it's fairly important.

And this leads me to the second topic I feel is worth discussing at this point...

#2 - If it's so important, why do we turn away? Why do we fail to ask the deeper questions? What gets in the way? And how can we remove these obstacles to reignite and fuel our natural question-asking?

Well first, I think that, rather than being an absolute thing (asking questions or not), it's more of a spectrum or sliding scale, where we all ask these deeper questions to _some_ extent, and shy away from them sometimes, too. It's just a question of how much of each, and, most importantly, why? If we understand what causes us to lean towards one or the other and how we can affect these causes, we can begin to tip the scales towards a healthy, courageous curiosity that will support us throughout our lives.

To answer this properly, we'd need to dive into why we do _anything_ - i.e. motivational psychology, decision-making, values, etc. I think this stuff is incredibly important, and I look forward to exploring a few models that I've found extremely useful with you soon... 

But for now, for the sake of flow and brevity, I'm just going to list off the main factors I've noticed in myself (and my friends and clients). The idea here is to try and hold up a mirror for you so you can become aware of any of these sticking points _you_ might have - and with that simple awareness comes the rediscovery of "choice" and the potential for becoming unstuck.

These factors fall into two main groups:

**Positive expected outcome of not questioning things, eg:**

- Evolutionary (short-term) benefit of maintaining an air of certainty, confidence, and control - so it's easier for you to act, and easier for others to follow and give you status.
- The little emotional kick of ego, pride, and *feeling* right (without even necessarily needing to *be* right).
- Rewarded socially for conforming and not asking questions, for being like everyone else. Able to feel some sense of connection and "safety in the herd".
- Rewarded socially for playing a particular role (usually unconsciously), and developing a sense of identity around that. For example, playing the victim or weakling as a child, and being rewarded (with sweets, attention, mollycoddling, etc.) for it. This can lead to an unconscious drive to avoid anything that you sense might be good for you (eg. asking questions), and if you're going to "win", you're probably going to make it really hard for yourself.

**Negative expected outcome of questioning things, eg:**

- Heard "stop asking questions" from bored parents and/or teachers
- Heard "you're dumb" or "you're useless", so you gave up thinking for yourself
- Possibility of actually (temporarily) being dumb or relatively incapable of quality thinking and action, due to poor physiology and your mind being all over the place (eg. really underslept, been eating poorly, filled your mind with cat videos, haven't been meditating, stressed with other, seemingly more urgent, concerns and opportunity).
- A general fear of the unknown, the uncertainty, and the loss of control that can come with questioning our beliefs and admitting we don't know for sure
- The fear of the sunk cost - "Damn, I've believed and lived this for so long, look at all that wasted time, look at everything I could have been doing."
- The fear of other imagined negative consequences - For example, I was raised as a Christian, and when, at age 11, I started to have doubts about my beliefs and the existence of a God, I was resistant to following those trains of thought in case God *did* exist and I went to hell, and for fear of separating myself from and angering my mum.

After looking at all that, it'd be reasonable to think, "Wow, that's a lot... Is it really worth it?"

But if you really look at it, most of these fears and internalized limiting self-attitudes are illusory (you _can_ handle it - don't buy into the shame, you're not defective, you're beautiful and you have so much potential), and these apparent rewards are typically shallow, fleeting, and unfulfilling.

(/Essentially, not until we've met our 4 basic needs, able to move from I to We, socialized... We might feel very insecure as it... Harder... We'll be addressing this stuff if you can push through, but otherwise you might have to go away and do your best with your health/sex and your ego/relationships for a while... You might be ready for this, you might not be. Either way, it's great).

It might help to break fear down a bit<sup>1</sup>. Fear is the anticipation that "X bad thing will happen", and _also_ that _we won't be able to handle it._ But chances are, you probably can handle it. And if you're unsure, perhaps get a support system in place to help you with whatever particular challenge it is you're facing.

And as far as solving for "actually being dumb and incapable" - we can always get better in this regard. Weirdly, a lot of it seems to be just basic physiological health - that is, if you want to dramatically increase your mental processing power, I can recommend getting better sleep, eating clean + staying hydrated, and regular meditation<sup>1.1</sup>. It's amazing how much of a difference a couple simple fixes like that can make.

Although it's still not always easy, I'd suggest that the pros do clearly outweigh the cons... It's just a question of short-term discomfort for long-term peace. If not, then you might just need to suffer more as a result of this stuff, until you have a "fuck this" moment, and / or you just get bored and fed up of the lack of honesty and authenticity.

It also might help to consider that, from one perspective, it's always a win to ask these difficult questions and challenge your own belief systems: if it's true, you have nothing to fear, because you'll question it and it'll come back around to the same truth. If it's not true, then it has no power over you, and you've just saved yourself a lot of pain and delusion and heartache. Also, no matter the result, your self-esteem goes up, because you're facing reality head-on, you're not turning away. This makes you more effective at whatever's most important to you, and more deeply happy.
