# The ways of the world
### Created by Cameron Hill

There just happens to be a particular way we like to write about the world...
Sometimes, we feel joy and peace and beauty and love and life.
Other times, we feel deathly afraid, a deep-seated tension, in pain.

The tendency is to try to avoid one or the other - after all, we humans are programmed to move away from pain/suffering and towards pleasure as a survival mechanism.
We do not pay attention to the important things - merely the urgent.
We trade short-term over long-term.
We take the easier road, rather than the harder road of "right action".

What are we left with?
A desolate society.
One in which we do not think things through thoroughly.
One that is full of delusion and divide and demise.
(At least, that's how it _seems_ - see [here](https://amzn.to/2AKyKCg) and [here](https://amzn.to/3fD884A) for another perspective...)

So what now?
How do we navigate this world?
What "should" we do, and why?

In essence, I think it's pretty simple... 

Evolution, perspective, connection, openness.
If you dive deep enough, pretty much all our challenges come from a lack of this spiritual/mental/emotional growth - from getting stuck, through thinking we’re right when we’re not (we never are - partial truths/perspectives/blindspots, spectrum, mystery), and that’s from a contraction from / resistance to opening/uncertainty.
This contraction has a time and a place - short term survival. But heal it after, because it gets stuck, and most of the time we're gucci.
So we want to train it, to learn - to get the feeling for quality (w/ feedback), & then take that into increasingly difficult situations throughout life.
We can artificially deconstruct life into different areas/skills, so we can train them separately, and flow as the whole. Eg. Skills… Habits… HRV.
