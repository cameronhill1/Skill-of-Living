## A Few Challenges and A Few Potential Solutions

This page is set aside to present what I think are the biggest challenges we face today as a species, and more importantly, suggest a few ideas to solve them.

I'm working on a couple of these, but most I'm not. I believe that all of these are not only big problems, but (therefore) also big business opportunities, if you're that way inclined.

If you want to "win" in business, it seems important to find the intersection of your passion, your unique experience and skillsets (what could you genuinely be the best in the world at, where are you right and everyone else is wrong), and a massive (billion person) problem.

Also, don't think small. Start small, but try to make your solution technologically-based so it can scale exponentially. Coding is pretty much essential as a founder nowadays, I would suggest. Or at least co-found with someone smart, determined, and [great.](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html){:target="_blank"} 

Not that it has to be a business. It could be a non-profit, or a community project, or a DAO ([decentralized autonomous organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization){:target="_blank"} - in theory, I really like these and think they have HUGE potential - we'll see about practice).

Anyways, I've got more on business / systems elsewhere on this site, and some good book recommendations lying around too. For now, let's get into it...

### Cycle of importance

We want to identify the most important challenges at any one moment, and solve them as effectively and quickly as possible. We might call this adaptability. So...

![Image](valuable_adaptability.png)

Let's walk through this model I've been playing with.

**1. Value Identification**

Perhaps the most important thing to work on, the most important question to answer, the most important challenge to solve, is... Well, that! *What's important.*

Before we can solve a problem, we need to know what things are problems and what aren't. And if we define a problem as something that keeps us from something else we value as important, it follows that, in order to do meaningful things, we should look at what's important (if anything), and why.

This starts to fall into the realms of philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, etc.

...






**2. Obstacle Identification**

Here, it's not just about identifying the obstacles and problems...

But identifying the few that are the highest leverage to solve.

It's about etiology, and not mistaking symptoms for problems, but diving down to the root.

It's also about timing - which are ripe for solution, and which need another decade in the incubator?

There are many factors that play into the timing... (people, tech, resources, etc.)



**3. Solution Creation**

With the currently (and soon-to-be) available tech and resources, how can we solve this problem? How can we create a system, a product, and/or a service to overcome this challenge?

As we move from step 2 to 3, we become concerned with how to optimally organize our resources, including our somewhat primary resources of energy and intelligence / skill / ability / information... people + tech + data, w/ HI... 

Economics<sup>1</sup> as simply a part of this organization, this overarching system.









**4. Resources Evolve**

Perhaps more generalized / accurate at this point is "resources & situation change".

Ideally, if we've done "good" things, and we chose to value our resources, the resources we have at our disposal will develop, evolve, increase.

This gives us a better ability to solve the old problems, and any new problems that we are now identifying with the changing landscape.

Again, this includes the primary resources like energy, intelligence / wisdom / ability / skill, tech, data/info, etc.

This is at the bottom of the diagram because, although it's last, it also provides the foundation for the others.

I've put it last in the sequence because I think direction or vector or quality is more important than speed or size of impact.

*
Out of the above 4, I'd suggest that the values piece is the one that is most often missed. We don't ask "why", we don't question our intentions, we don't go deeper.

This is dangerous, because we can quite quickly find ourselves moving faster and faster down roads that we may not want to go down.

The Farnam Street blog summarizes this beautifully in one of their core principles - "Direction over speed." Or quality over quantity.

And really, it's also not just about thinking about the direction all the time. It's both - direction, move forward; action, course correct. This is adaptability, or learning, at it's core.

What gets in the way for us is a tendency to get stuck in one way of doing things without re-examining things, without *unlearning*.

So what is really required is being able to continually balance deep "being" and massive "doing", knowing and not-knowing, learning and unlearning...

In fact, not just to balance them, but to have them feed into each other reciprocally. Where we use the doing as feedback, and use the chaos to drive us into the present more deeply - and in return, the presence fills our doing with quality, and maximizes our odds of doing useful work.

(To be aware. Not to lose sight of the Why, the enjoyment...)

*
So perhaps. Organizing, group flow (cycle)... v important...

Then a walkthrough of my / our current ideas and research (linked companies etc.;)


Primary value - happiness, enjoyment, being madly in love with life?

Data, two way...

General idea of cutting out middlemen and approaching zero cost for everything... (DAOs?)

4 - Balance, and enjoyment of life -> intelligence and energy... 




Tiers of importance of things to work on… 

What guides the tiers themselves - philosophy, as humans, as/with AI (perhaps Swarm), + as HI - eg. care, connectedness, transcend & include… 
The contents of the tiers, and updating this dynamically
Enjoyment of living - First and foremost, the highest leverage thing you can do is to focus on falling in love with life.

The optimal organization of primary resources (perhaps energy/information/intelligence) - including collaboration - into the contents, and updating this dynamically
The continued development of the resources (energy/information/intelligence) - eg. enjoyment, health, relationships, (finances/)work/service, (machine/HI) learning - group flow cycle… 
Extracting the optimally balanced (eg. short/long term) output/creativity from the resources
The improvement of feedback loops for the above.

Then into other stuff, eg.

Bio/nanotech (perhaps above…) as platforms
Companies sharing our data + their insights with us so we can learn from it too - win-win
Economics - importance of aligning short & long term - and removing the barriers to this (stress, fear, cortisol, -> lack of perspective and short-term thinking) - and incentivizing this.
Energy - clean, cheap
Self-sufficiency and efficiency (through skills & systems) in basic needs… for all. Shelter, food, water, health/immunity and sanitation, money, education, sustainable living, consumption & healing (short & long-term) for all life, systems of connection, communication, and organization





***

FAQ - If establishing a direction sits downstream of our primary resources (intelligence, energy, information, etc.), then why isn't first?

Hmm this is a really hard one. I think that it's actually a feedback loop - increased intelligence -> course correction -> increased intelligence. 

Do your best and course correct?


...


What about awareness? For feedback...

1 - A word on the demonetization of money - it's very conceivable to me that we solve the basic challenges of life sufficiently well enough within the next few decades for all of us such that it can be done without work... And when we're abundantly happy and at peace within ourselves, and deeply connected, such that we don't need to get newer advances before others (and where time from available to 1 to democratized gets ever smaller), where money has served its purpose, and we let go of it... We'd still use money as a means of exchange, but it's just a completely different ball-game. We don't exactly *need* to work for money, but we choose to because we've found what we love to do and it doesn't feel like work at all.
