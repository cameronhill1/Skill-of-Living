## A Few Challenges and a Few Potential Solutions

This page is set aside to present what I think are the biggest challenges we face today as a species, and more importantly, suggest a few ideas to solve them.

I'm working on a couple of these, but most I'm not. I believe that all of these are not only big problems, but (therefore) also big business opportunities, if you're that way inclined.

If you want to "win" in business, it seems important to find the intersection of your passion, your unique experience and skillsets (what could you genuinely be the best in the world at, where are you right and everyone else is wrong), and a massive (billion person) problem.

Also, don't think small. Start small, but try to make your solution technologically-based so it can scale exponentially. Coding is pretty much essential as a founder nowadays, I would suggest. Or at least co-found with someone smart, determined, and [great.](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html){:target="_blank"} 

Not that it has to be a business. It could be a non-profit, or a community project, or a DAO ([decentralized autonomous organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization){:target="_blank"} - in theory, I really like these and think they have HUGE potential - we'll see about practice).

Anyways, I've got more on business / systems elsewhere on this site, and some good book recommendations lying around too. For now, let's get into it...

We want to identify the most important challenges at any one moment, and solve them as effectively and quickly as possible (adaptability). So...

### Cycle of importance

- What are the guiding principles underlying the tiers (and their contents)?
  - In effect, some philosophy and how to live in alignment with it. That's the purpose of this site.
  - 



- The optimal organization of primary resources (



First and foremost, the highest leverage thing you can do is to focus on falling in love with life.






Tiers of importance of things to work on… 

What guides the tiers themselves - philosophy, as humans, as/with AI (perhaps Swarm), + as HI - eg. care, connectedness, transcend & include… 
The contents of the tiers, and updating this dynamically
Enjoyment of living

The optimal organization of primary resources (perhaps energy/information/intelligence) - including collaboration - into the contents, and updating this dynamically
The continued development of the resources (energy/information/intelligence) - eg. enjoyment, health, relationships, (finances/)work/service, (machine/HI) learning - group flow cycle… 
Extracting the optimally balanced (eg. short/long term) output/creativity from the resources
The improvement of feedback loops for the above.

Then into other stuff, eg.

Bio/nanotech (perhaps above…) as platforms
Companies sharing our data + their insights with us so we can learn from it too - win-win
Economics - importance of aligning short & long term - and removing the barriers to this (stress, fear, cortisol, -> lack of perspective and short-term thinking) - and incentivizing this.
Energy - clean, cheap
Self-sufficiency and efficiency (through skills & systems) in basic needs… for all. Shelter, food, water, health/immunity and sanitation, money, education, sustainable living, consumption & healing (short & long-term) for all life, systems of connection, communication, and organization

FAQ - If establishing a direction sits downstream of our primary resources (intelligence, energy, information, etc.), then why isn't first?

Hmm this is a really hard one. I think that it's actually a feedback loop - increased intelligence -> course correction -> increased intelligence. 

Do your best and course correct?

What about awareness? For feedback...
