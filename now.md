# Open, Now

```
Kinda like a public journal, here you'll find: what's on my heart and mind, ideas I'm playing with, what I'm focusing on and why, updates on skills I'm learning, etc.

Just because something is written here, it does not mean that it is true or valuable, or even that I believe it to be so. It's purely to share what's going on with me right now, in case you're wondering. I find it gives meaning to my struggles, and multiplicity to my celebrations.

## 3.30AM July 16th 2020

I've been clarifying the structure and format of this site recently.

Also been building out the recs section too. Found myself adding more and more resources, while trying to refine it.

Noticed that I get quite wordy with my writing sometimes. Unnecessarily so. Let's see how that goes.

Been feeling a subtle shift take place... I may also be imagining things due to a continued loss of sleep, but...

I became quite obvious to me that a lot of the "demonstration of the teaching" reason for music and singing is actually just ego and  "look at me" mindset, and rationalization for egoic self-aggrandizement.

Like, what do I have to teach? I teach that I have nothing to teach, but I have some ideas - take them or leave them. Yet I'm focusing on "demonstrating" like I think I'm right and have something to sell.

Is it not more about just living it, and naturally sharing? Who knows...

This has coincided with a shift with music. Following the couple days when I went more "all-in", I found that I was feeling naturally more drawn towards coding, coaching, and entrepreneurship, right now.

I still love singing, and really enjoy making music & writing songs. I could definitely imagine myself doing something with this in the future.

And I've also realized how early I am in the music journey - just 15 months! No rush to "do something with it"... The whole point is the enjoyment. This stuff takes time, and a lot of it will be helped and the essence developed doing the other stuff (eg. ear from resilient presence, songwriting from coaching, more lessons from entrepreneurship)... 

So I'm thinking of cutting down my singing lessons, perhaps to 1/month. Practice time will also most likely not be the 2-3+ hours a day it has been. Let's see how it goes.

Yeah, I'm feeling more and more aligned with Skill of Health too.

Talking of the skill of health, I need to practice sleeping more. Just coming up to 4am. Last night was 5am bed. Getting kinda trashed. Quality is dropping. Can still get present, but things take longer. Back to quality.

Also, as a pre-bed sidenote, been feeling super horny lately, couped up in lockdown. Having occasional weird thoughts and super sexual dreams. Maybe I'll head abroad... Or just get out the house a bit aha.

Good night ;)


## 1AM July 11th 2020

The past few days, I've been consistent with this site, doing at least an hour or two, sometimes more, in the evenings.

Amazed at how quickly the body adapts to less sleep. For a while, I've been aiming to sleep 9-10 hours a night, and obsessing over the quality. Lately, I've been averaging maybe 5-6 hours a night, on a sofa with a cat or two, in a very light room.

Although, of course, I *do* feel better when I'm sleeping well, and I *am* noticing reduced athletic and HRV performance, I am *not* self-destructing or struggling as much as I thought I would (and as the occasional night of poor sleep suggested I might). My energy levels are the same, if not higher. I'm still able to think reasonably clearly. I can still hold (and enjoy) a conversation.

Not ideal, not long-term, but not the end of the world. Perhaps more important is just focusing on doing things that fulfil you deeply, make you happy. Eg. This site, and...

I've also been singing a lot more (2 focused hours per day, with more throughout the afternoon and evening), and I'm noticing the results. Really happy with the progress - tone is improving (back on the old "La Ga" exercises I was doing), authenticity is improving, phrasing is improving, pitching is improving a bit (I think)...

Been noticing that my thoughts have been running away a little with the progress - whether it's in singing, in health and physique, in this site (I've been clarifying the structure and working on some models that have been pleasing), the mind starts coming up with stories of how impressed people will be, how much people (especially quality women, and men I look up to) will admire me and praise me, what it might lead to, etc.

And I'm getting kinda bored of it now, haha, to be honest. Yes there's clearly a big part of me that focuses on these things for the approval, the recognition, the practical benefits. But I also just love doing these things. I also just want to be "out here", with you, and for you. To connect. To create. To share. To express. To live. To love.

So yeah. Thanks for being here with me. xx


## 1AM July 7th 2020

Hello! Been a couple days...

Been working on this consistently, though still taking Sundays off (for perspective and taking a step back).

Just filled out some of the Recs page (book descriptions), and felt inspired to fill out the Tl;Dr page a bit.

Been wondering today, as I fall more and more deeply in love with singing and music, how much of the "need to get this out the way" is real.

That is, there's been a story going on for a while of "This is just something I need to do. Once I've done this, I can die / let go fully." 

But I'm getting the sense that the continual "retreat" into the theory and the philosophy and morality, etc. "for the benefit of others and myself" - or in other words, aligning things completely so it's clear and we can just live it... Is a way to *postpone* letting go into just living it. I'm noticing a slight fear around that. "But will I be okay without continual thinking, planning, strategizing?" Perhaps the answer's "No, but I'll be more 'okay' than *with* it."

Also, if Knowing is beyond reason, and we rationalize for our emotions anyways... It's less about convincing, and more about demonstrating, inspiring.

And the practical manifestations of all this are really quite simple (eg. HRV training, maybe an introductory course, simple health recommendations, reviewing something / affs...)

I mean, maybe it IS both. There's probably value in aligning things rationally, once we've had a taste of the Truth. So we can inspire through living IT, and then point so we have some ground for it. It helps to elevate the structure with the state. Perhaps.

Ultimately, I feel it's right to continue this, to build it out Well, to continue to evolve with it over time. But I also feel it taking a slightly more backseat role. I still love it.

But I'm particularly on fire with singing and music at the moment - from just doing it more, and expressing myself more with it I suppose. Also watching some really inspirational videos of singing auditions today. Beautiful stuff. While I was typing away earlier, I thought of Birdy's version of Skinny Love and my heart nearly burst. Like, that's what it felt like. I was listening to it this afternoon and as I started to sing along I just started crying. I could barely get the words out.

Man. Life is fucking beautiful.



## 3.30AM July 2nd 2020

Just a quick entry tonight, following a shorter session - just over 2 hours. Feeling pretty tired, and want to get to bed a bit earlier.

It's amazing how quickly a lack of sleep can you make you pretty stupid - and the increased cortisol seems to ramp up the identification with the ego / the socialized self.

That being said, had some good insights today (or so I think). Playing around with "gratitude" as a powerful cue for pointing to "the sweetspot", and realized that the "expected value" model of working with probabilities works really well when applied to motivational psychology / decision making, being informed by past experiences.

Also, just generally feeling in a really good place at the moment. Enjoying working on this stuff. Other things are ticking along nicely. Really enjoying singing, more than ever. And had a call with my friends at the LA food bank - they just expressed massive gratitude for the work I was doing with them (running ads, we've generated $1.5m for them over the past 4 months or so). One of them was "in the field", volunteering at the drive-thru care package handouts. They shared some other exciting news too, which I won't repeat here...

This was all very gratifying, and I kinda went quiet and just said thank you as my heart warmed. It's absolutely a team effort, and I can't take too much credit for the ads performance anyways - we're really riding an unfortunately incredible wave here - but it is really nice to connect the numbers with the people we're actually helping. $1.5m is in the region of 5-10m meals - and with 20% unemployment rate in LA right now, people who have never needed food before are driving up in nice cars and receiving much-needed assistance. So I'm feeling quite inspired right now.

BUT loving others starts with loving yourself, and so I'm off to bed. Good night. <3


## 5AM July 1st 2020

Just finishing up a 5-hour shift.

Was very tired following yesterday's all-nighter (went to sleep at 7.30am, woke around 12.30pm), and was planning to just do a shorter one (1-2 hours), but when I got to 1-2 hours, I was really getting into the flow, and so I just kept going.

Weirdly, I'm enjoying working with no breaks (not even toilet breaks - I deliberately stopped drinking water a couple hours beforehand). Obviously, these behaviours are probably a little unsustainable, but it's fun and seems to be working... i.e, I seem to be working.

Interesting how these behaviours are the complete opposite to what I've been aiming for, as far as a routine goes... And yet produced the very results I was searching for, perhaps without even realizing it. Perhaps this demonstrates the power of "doing the opposite" to break out of unwittingly limiting patterns of behaviour / belief, and of the utility of chaos for focusing the mind.

Although, the flipside of that is that this work has been pretty much completely uninterrupted (by parents, pets, parcels, piss-breaks...), and the joy of this has helped me to be completely cool with shifting my routine around while I'm here, at least for a little while longer during lockdown - even if there are definite downsides. The other routine I've been trying to get into is better on paper, but in a relatively complex and chaotic environment, perhaps it falls short on executability/adherence relative to something like this.

Ideally, I want to work some good sleep back into the schedule too. That's important. I've got a lot of sleep to catch up on atm. My workouts are suffering. My HRV scores (Oura and EW2 feedback training) are suffering.

Alright. I'm happy. Good night. <3 :)



## 2.30AM 30th June 2020

Just finished a 4-hour shift of writing on the main site. Woo! :D Couple insights that contributed to this I think...

First, the end of [this 3-min article](https://markmanson.net/liberation-not-knowing){:target="_blank"} from Mark Manson hit me pretty hard - I could relate a lot. Even if I don't see myself as a writer, I have developed a bit of a prospective ego around the ideas, having fanciful visions of the impact it might have, the praise I might get, etc. This puts loads of pressure on it, and makes it extremely difficult to actually **do** anything. I realized, although I've been very much aware of this seemingly mutually exclusive trade-off between talking it and living it, I have indeed formed an ego (talking/thinking) as a way to simulate the rewards of the results without the risk (or the actual results).

And we all do this to some extent. We all have our ways that we get some of the kick without any immediately obvious downside. It's our "productive procrastination." The other "insight" was relating all this to a friend I walked with this evening, who has found himself playing lots of creative-engineering based games in lockdown, rather than pursue a career in said creative-engineering - a long-time passion of his...

But there IS a downside, and the downside is insidious. It's that you think you're making progress, and maybe you are in some ways, but you're not in other ways - and unfortunately, perhaps those other ways are more important.

It seems as though I've got pretty good at this productive procrastination / rationalization. Here's the key: You deliberately fill your schedule and make it extremely elaborate and detailed. Every minute of the day is planned for. And it's all with seemingly very important stuff. You don't really know what you'd remove if you had to remove something. Then, the key is to maintain a general level of confusion (even if you know deep down) around what it is you want to be working on, and to do things that you say are important for XYZ, and arguably are... but they're not XYZ. AND, for bonus points, continually travel around, change time zones, and regularly lay in bed for several hours without getting to sleep - these are perfect reasons for falling out of your schedule, at which point the only natural response is to complete everything but the "one thing", or things leading up to that. If you do it, it's hard to get some deep, focused work in on it.

The thing is, it's hard JUST DOING the thing you love, the thing you care about a lot, the thing you feel called to do (right now). Because you're putting yourself out there. You have an idea of what you want to do, and who you want to be, and you're afraid you won't live up to that.

(It's Steven Pressfield's Resistance. But man, I thought I didn't have it, but I do. I'm just a master at convincing myself that I'm not resisting it, when I am somewhat.)

But it's only by NOT living up to it, for a long time, that we can actually live up to it. It's only by taking loads of action, in the present, with feedback, that we actually get better. Directness (actually doing the thing you want to get good at) is a big key for skill acquisition (Ultralearning is a good book on this).

Anyways. I also realized that, if I'm going to form an ego (which I am somewhat - we transcend and include the ego, rather than repress it), I should form an ego around having no ego. I've long thought of this as the "story to no story", or "meaning of no meaning" paradox. And I've been aware of this fix as well (ego of [results](https://medium.com/@graham.duncan/the-playing-field-dfb9a1473f43){:target="_blank"}).

But this became a little more real, to the point I could feel it challenging my identity and calling me to take actions I wouldn't normally take, with the sentence:

"Letting go of the idea of it, talking/thinking about it... Not the "smart" guy, but the action/results/process/learning/Quality-through-doing-Now-with-feedback guy.

"**I'm the Quality-through-doing-Now-with-feedback guy**, (not the smart guy)."

All my life, I've felt like I've had to be the smart guy, had to be right. I always got validation and approval through good grades, test scores, quality thinking, etc. But that's not necessarily the way. It's useful to a point, but like Peter Thiel says, “Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.”

The only thing I might add to this - the best way (maybe the only way) to solve all this is to just do it. Over and over. With presence, Quality, enjoyment. Start, keep going, finish well.


## 27th June 2020

Who? Open, Now.
Love until it hurts.

As I write this, all is quiet.
The cat scratches its ears, licks its own fur.
There's a fly dancing near me, just chilling.
Circles, then rest.

I've just finished Grace and Grit (A Love Story) by Ken Wilber, and it comes with my highest recommendations. I will be including it in the /recs section of this site (as soon as I make it, that is).
I won't go into too much detail here and now, except to say that it quite possibly the most inspiring and moving story I've read... and it's non-fiction.
It's the story of Ken (one of my favourite authors anyway, check out his other work, it'll change your life), his wife Treya, and her (their) 5-year battle with cancer.
I teared up many times throughout the book, openly cried at a few parts, and sobbed pretty violently for a lot of the last chapter or two. Such beauty. Such love. Such courage.

I think reading this book over the past couple weeks has influenced me in "just starting" with this site, and openly sharing things, raw and real.
I already "knew", intellectually, that I wanted to do it this way, but I was "moved" more, emotionally, through seeing her example.
This is already proving to be quite healing for me, and I hope, at some point, somewhat helpful to you.

Called to practice more deeply, both "formally", and MOST importantly, moment to moment. When it's hardest.
Can you (and I) dive deeply into life, with all its joy and pain and suffering... And do so with equanimity? With a smile?

I want to sing.
I want to serve.
And I want to do it with you, my dear.


## 26th June 2020

Just building out this site.
Will anyone like it?
Hehe. I already like it :)

Noticed a little self-judgement and/or remorse at not having moved from "learning phase" to "creation phase" sooner, particularly with the "core" section of the site, which I've been working on, on and off, for a couple years in various forms (paid program, free program, article series...)

I think, at times, we all struggle with moving from "talking" about things, to actually "doing" them.

Talking and thinking about it is relatively easy. Nothing new happens. There are fewer risks. You can't succeed, but you can't fail (or so you think).

Actually DOING things requires more presence, putting yourself out there, a willingness to be wrong and called out for it.

I can get stuck in perfectionism, and productive procrastination. I can get lost in the details and the relatively unimportant.

What's leading me to build it out now? I'm not sure - probably a convergence of a few different events.

For example, I'm feeling more and more like it's not that big a deal. Just throw it up and edit it as we go.

Also, I feel I'm becoming a little less self-centered lately, and more deeply happy. I've been getting back to some core practices that have worked well before (eg. HRV training, being more socially Open, a slightly modified tonglen practice with really slow inhales and exhales...), and I think these have contributed to genuine feelings of peace, fulfilment, aliveness, connectedness, beauty...

And simultaneously, the awareness that there is suffering, and that I may be able to help, even if it's just a bit.




## Before 26th June 2020

Life

(NB, Here I explore some core themes of my life up until this journal entry. As well as my happinesses and successes, I also share my "quality problems". This is not intended as a victim story or a shirking of responsibility, nor am I lamenting even the toughest stuff I've been through - My problems were mild enough that I can see the beauty in them without too much difficulty, and I feel very appreciative to have had such an overall positive upbringing. I'm sharing here for a couple reasons: For fun, for completeness (having a full timeline here), and for connecting around our common humanity. I've enjoyed writing it, so I hope you might be able to enjoy reading it ;) )

J met N at the NEC in Birmingham.
They got together a couple years later.
About 4 years later Cameron was born.
Didn't cry much as a baby, I hear.
Growing up, I had the standard "quality problems"<sup>1</sup> and insecurities most kids have, I suppose...
I was very sure I loved girls a lot. And I also loved lots of girls. I remember one particular time listing off to a friend (or maybe it was my mum) about 11 different girls that I loved. Though I was about 5 or 6, they ranged in ages from 4-11, I believe. Looking back on it now, they didn't even have to be too pretty! Although that was the deciding factor sometimes, the quality I was most drawn to, I think, was kindness. Hmm. Maybe I really did love them all.
Hehe, anyways, they didn't always love me back, at least not "romantically" (as romantic as love can be between 6-year olds), and if they did, they didn't always share it as openly as I did.
Ha, for example, I remember with one girl in our class (whose mum was also our teacher)... I walked into the classroom one day and shouted out "Mrs D, I love your daughter!" very loud, so the whole class could hear it. I guess I was proud of my love and couldn't contain it any longer :D I smiled a big grin and turned red as everyone laughed.
I also remember being a bit younger, maybe 3 or 4, and sleeping over at a (girl) friend's house. We were discussing our somewhat mutual feelings for each other... I said I loved her, and she said he loved me too... but she also thought she loved another boy at her school! I remember feeling a little disappointed and small, imagining this other 4-year old to be tall and cool and confident - the perfect gentleman. Though perhaps he was thinking the same about me... If only I'd known that you could love more than one person at a time, that polyamory was a thing...
I don't think I ever really questioned my worth or ability... Until I started questioning it :P I'm not sure what led to that, but perhaps it was taking things like that personally, and then comparing myself with others to see "what might be missing". Why would my friends leave me out, or a girl runaway from me (in kiss-chase), unless I wasn't good enough for them, unless I was missing something?
Don't get me wrong, I had friends, some admirers, I was pretty popular (all the way throughout school)... But this still affected me. And I experienced similar versions of this throughout my childhood, as I got older. In fact, much of my earlier years was formed by reacting to these events and insecurities. And I think this still affects me to this day to some extent - it's a little bit of a chip on my shoulder.
One example - When I was about 6 or 7, I thought I was fat. I actually had very little fat on me, but had a large belly from undiagnosed digestive problems. So I thought I was fat. I remember turning away from the girls in the classroom while I changed my top for PE, or being afraid to take my T-shirt off on holidays or for swimming. I remember revealing to my 2 (quite lean) best friends that I had a big secret I wanted to tell them, and when I said "I'm fat" and showed them my belly, they just said "yeah we know". It wasn't a big deal to them I guess.
So when, nudged by my teachers and family friends, my parents began to look at moving me to a private school in Oxford (that offered good bursaries) and asked me what I wanted to do, I was very keen when I found out that: A. My best friend at the time also happened to be applying, and B. They had a "fitness suite". It was only once I arrived at the school that I found out that, ridiculously, they didn't let 8/9 year olds in the gym, and that I'd have to wait until I was 11! I was crushed, and with no girls in sight (single-sex school), I naturally threw myself into studies, chess, and cricket, was chosen as head boy at the end of my first year, and waited excitedly for the time I'd get to start hanging out with girls "in town", when we moved from "junior school" to "senior school".
All looked good on the surface... 



(Proudest Dad in the world, now look at you, it's pathetic)...

(Addictions to games, sat on the hill, etc.)

(Rugby saved me... got into it for the "wrong" reasons, and fell in love with it for the "right" reasons...)





What does it mean to be a strong man nowadays? The balance of tough and vulnerable, of X and Y, of A and B...
I'm lucky I had such great role models... John Place, Grant Seeley, Spencer Goggin and the other Sports staff, Eric Thomas & Elliott Hulse
Each of these men saw something in me that I could not see in myself, and believed in me, supported me, encouraged me. I would not be anywhere close to the man I am proud to be today without any one of these men. And of course, my biological dad too. Although there were things I did not want to emulate (and that's tough, because as the child you see your parents at their worst, remember the bad times more than the good, and hold them to standards of perfection), what I did learn from my dad was a courage to take responsibility for your own results in life, to grab your balls and commit, and to keep fucking going no matter what. To go on after your dreams no matter what. After reading a lot, looking further afield, I think I've found easier paths to get better results... But it was only thanks to his graft, his patience, and his eventual acceptance of my choices, that I've been able to educate myself in these ways. So I am eternally and incredibly grateful to this man, J.
