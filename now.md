# Open, Now

```
Kinda like a public journal, here you'll find: what's on my heart and mind, ideas I'm playing with, what I'm focusing on and why, updates on skills I'm learning, etc.

Just because something is written here, it does not mean that it is true or valuable, or even that I believe it to be so. It's purely to share what's going on with me right now, in case you're wondering. I find it gives meaning to my struggles, and multiplicity to my celebrations.

## 5AM July 1st 2020

Just finishing up a 5-hour shift.

Was very tired following yesterday's all-nighter (went to sleep at 7.30am, woke around 12.30pm), and was planning to just do a shorter one (1-2 hours), but when I got to 1-2 hours, I was really getting into the flow, and so I just kept going.

Weirdly, I'm enjoying working with no breaks (not even toilet breaks - I deliberately stopped drinking water a couple hours beforehand). Obviously, these behaviours are probably a little unsustainable, but it's fun and seems to be working... i.e, I seem to be working.

Interesting how these behaviours are the complete opposite to what I've been aiming for, as far as a routine goes... And yet produced the very results I was searching for, perhaps without even realizing it. Perhaps this demonstrates the power of "doing the opposite" to break out of unwittingly limiting patterns of behaviour / belief, and of the utility of chaos for focusing the mind.

Although, the flipside of that is that this work has been pretty much completely uninterrupted (by parents, pets, parcels, piss-breaks...), and the joy of this has helped me to be completely cool with shifting my routine around while I'm here, at least for a little while longer during lockdown - even if there are definite downsides. The other routine I've been trying to get into is better on paper, but in a relatively complex and chaotic environment, perhaps it falls short on executability/adherence relative to something like this.

Ideally, I want to work some good sleep back into the schedule too. That's important. I've got a lot of sleep to catch up on atm. My workouts are suffering. My HRV scores (Oura and EW2 feedback training) are suffering.

Alright. I'm happy. Good night. <3 :)



## 2.30AM 30th June 2020

Just finished a 4-hour shift of writing on the main site. Woo! :D Couple insights that contributed to this I think...

First, the end of [this 3-min article](https://markmanson.net/liberation-not-knowing){:target="_blank"} from Mark Manson hit me pretty hard - I could relate a lot. Even if I don't see myself as a writer, I have developed a bit of a prospective ego around the ideas, having fanciful visions of the impact it might have, the praise I might get, etc. This puts loads of pressure on it, and makes it extremely difficult to actually **do** anything. I realized, although I've been very much aware of this seemingly mutually exclusive trade-off between talking it and living it, I have indeed formed an ego (talking/thinking) as a way to simulate the rewards of the results without the risk (or the actual results).

And we all do this to some extent. We all have our ways that we get some of the kick without any immediately obvious downside. It's our "productive procrastination." The other "insight" was relating all this to a friend I walked with this evening, who has found himself playing lots of creative-engineering based games in lockdown, rather than pursue a career in said creative-engineering - a long-time passion of his...

But there IS a downside, and the downside is insidious. It's that you think you're making progress, and maybe you are in some ways, but you're not in other ways - and unfortunately, perhaps those other ways are more important.

It seems as though I've got pretty good at this productive procrastination / rationalization. Here's the key: You deliberately fill your schedule and make it extremely elaborate and detailed. Every minute of the day is planned for. And it's all with seemingly very important stuff. You don't really know what you'd remove if you had to remove something. Then, the key is to maintain a general level of confusion (even if you know deep down) around what it is you want to be working on, and to do things that you say are important for XYZ, and arguably are... but they're not XYZ. AND, for bonus points, continually travel around, change time zones, and regularly lay in bed for several hours without getting to sleep - these are perfect reasons for falling out of your schedule, at which point the only natural response is to complete everything but the "one thing", or things leading up to that. If you do it, it's hard to get some deep, focused work in on it.

The thing is, it's hard JUST DOING the thing you love, the thing you care about a lot, the thing you feel called to do (right now). Because you're putting yourself out there. You have an idea of what you want to do, and who you want to be, and you're afraid you won't live up to that.

(It's Steven Pressfield's Resistance. But man, I thought I didn't have it, but I do. I'm just a master at convincing myself that I'm not resisting it, when I am somewhat.)

But it's only by NOT living up to it, for a long time, that we can actually live up to it. It's only by taking loads of action, in the present, with feedback, that we actually get better. Directness (actually doing the thing you want to get good at) is a big key for skill acquisition (Ultralearning is a good book on this).

Anyways. I also realized that, if I'm going to form an ego (which I am somewhat - we transcend and include the ego, rather than repress it), I should form an ego around having no ego. I've long thought of this as the "story to no story", or "meaning of no meaning" paradox. And I've been aware of this fix as well (ego of [results](https://medium.com/@graham.duncan/the-playing-field-dfb9a1473f43){:target="_blank"}).

But this became a little more real, to the point I could feel it challenging my identity and calling me to take actions I wouldn't normally take, with the sentence:

"Letting go of the idea of it, talking/thinking about it... Not the "smart" guy, but the action/results/process/learning/Quality-through-doing-Now-with-feedback guy.

"**I'm the Quality-through-doing-Now-with-feedback guy**, (not the smart guy)."

All my life, I've felt like I've had to be the smart guy, had to be right. I always got validation and approval through good grades, test scores, quality thinking, etc. But that's not necessarily the way. It's useful to a point, but like Peter Thiel says, “Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.”

The only thing I might add to this - the best way (maybe the only way) to solve all this is to just do it. Over and over. With presence, Quality, enjoyment. Start, keep going, finish well.

Who? Open, Now.
Love until it hurts.

As I write this, all is quiet.
The cat scratches its ears, licks its own fur.
There's a fly dancing near me, just chilling.
Circles, then rest.

I've just finished Grace and Grit (A Love Story) by Ken Wilber, and it comes with my highest recommendations. I will be including it in the /recs section of this site (as soon as I make it, that is).
I won't go into too much detail here and now, except to say that it quite possibly the most inspiring and moving story I've read... and it's non-fiction.
It's the story of Ken (one of my favourite authors anyway, check out his other work, it'll change your life), his wife Treya, and her (their) 5-year battle with cancer.
I teared up many times throughout the book, openly cried at a few parts, and sobbed pretty violently for a lot of the last chapter or two. Such beauty. Such love. Such courage.

I think reading this book over the past couple weeks has influenced me in "just starting" with this site, and openly sharing things, raw and real.
I already "knew", intellectually, that I wanted to do it this way, but I was "moved" more, emotionally, through seeing her example.
This is already proving to be quite healing for me, and I hope, at some point, somewhat helpful to you.

Called to practice more deeply, both "formally", and MOST importantly, moment to moment. When it's hardest.
Can you (and I) dive deeply into life, with all its joy and pain and suffering... And do so with equanimity? With a smile?

I want to sing.
I want to serve.
And I want to do it with you, my dear.


## 26th June 2020

Just building out this site.
Will anyone like it?
Hehe. I already like it :)

Noticed a little self-judgement and/or remorse at not having moved from "learning phase" to "creation phase" sooner, particularly with the "core" section of the site, which I've been working on, on and off, for a couple years in various forms (paid program, free program, article series...)

I think, at times, we all struggle with moving from "talking" about things, to actually "doing" them.

Talking and thinking about it is relatively easy. Nothing new happens. There are fewer risks. You can't succeed, but you can't fail (or so you think).

Actually DOING things requires more presence, putting yourself out there, a willingness to be wrong and called out for it.

I can get stuck in perfectionism, and productive procrastination. I can get lost in the details and the relatively unimportant.

What's leading me to build it out now? I'm not sure - probably a convergence of a few different events.

For example, I'm feeling more and more like it's not that big a deal. Just throw it up and edit it as we go.

Also, I feel I'm becoming a little less self-centered lately, and more deeply happy. I've been getting back to some core practices that have worked well before (eg. HRV training, being more socially Open, a slightly modified tonglen practice with really slow inhales and exhales...), and I think these have contributed to genuine feelings of peace, fulfilment, aliveness, connectedness, beauty...

And simultaneously, the awareness that there is suffering, and that I may be able to help, even if it's just a bit.

Life

J met N at the NEC in Birmingham.
They got together a couple years later.
About 4 years later Cameron was born.
Didn't cry much as a baby, I'm told.
Growing up, I had the typical beautiful challenges and insecurities most kids have...
