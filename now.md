# Open, Now

```
Kinda like a public journal, here you'll find: what's on my heart and mind, ideas I'm playing with, what I'm focusing on and why, updates on skills I'm learning, etc.

Just because something is written here, it does not mean that it is true or valuable, or even that I believe it to be so. It's purely to share what's going on with me right now, in case you're wondering. I find it gives meaning to my struggles, and multiplicity to my celebrations.

Just building out this site.
Will anyone like it?
Hehe. I already like it :)

Noticed a little self-judgement and/or remorse at not having moved from "learning phase" to "creation phase" sooner, particularly with the "core" section of the site, which I've been working on, on and off, for a couple years in various forms (paid program, free program, article series...)

I think, at times, we all struggle with moving from "talking" about things, to actually "doing" them.

Talking and thinking about it is relatively easy. Nothing new happens. There are fewer risks. You can't succeed, but you can't fail (or so you think).

Actually DOING things requires more presence, putting yourself out there, a willingness to be wrong and called out for it.

I can get stuck in perfectionism, and productive procrastination. I can get lost in the details and the relatively unimportant.

What's leading me to build it out now? I'm not sure - probably a convergence of a few different events.

For example, I'm feeling more and more like it's not that big a deal. Just throw it up and edit it as we go.

Also, I feel I'm becoming a little less self-centered lately, and more deeply happy. I've been getting back to some core practices that have worked well before (eg. HRV training, being more socially Open, a slightly modified tonglen practice with really slow inhales and exhales...), and I think these have contributed to genuine feelings of peace, fulfilment, aliveness, connectedness, beauty...

And simultaneously, the awareness that there is suffering, and that I may be able to help, even if it's just a bit.

Life

J met N at the NEC in Birmingham.
They got together a couple years later.
About 4 years later Cameron was born.
Didn't cry much as a baby, I'm told.
Growing up, I had the typical beautiful challenges and insecurities most kids have...
