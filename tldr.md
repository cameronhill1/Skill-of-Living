The mystery, and even "unknowability", of existence as primary.

So let's enjoy, celebrate existence, and play with knowing (learning), while knowing that we ultimately don't and can't know everything...?

We are life itself. Life has evolved, supposedly from the big bang, to us. We didn't "come into" this world; we are this world.

("Four and a half billion years ago, the Earth was a flaming molten ball of rock and now...it can sing opera." - Brian Swimme.)

It's a nice thing to know that intellectually, but it's quite liberating to feel that, to see things from that perspective.

This is relatively straightforward. From a foundation of reasonable health and low-ish cortisol levels, play around with "looking for the looker" - turning attention upon itself.

A typical experience is that "self" drops away, and we're left with a vast openness. Where our head was, there's only Life. And so we are left with a personal verification of what the sages and mystics have pointed to for millenia. No fireworks, no magic... just pure openness, and a sense of "tuning in" to a timeless "oneness".

Ego is a survival program that kicks in to control things and solve problems with lots of thinking. If we can keep to this openness, even as the desires and pulls arise (realizing we're not them), we quickly find ourselves letting go of desires and fears we've held for a long time - and we're left with an increasing stillness, peace, love, joy of being.

This state is also known as "flow", defined as "the state in which we feel and perform at our best". Not only are we at our happiest here, and not only are these experiences the ones that infuse our life with meaning, but we are also most adaptable and effective at solving problems here, too. We have access to our full creative and intuitive potential.

Flow has been notoriously difficult to attain or train, due to it's seemingly paradoxical and intangible nature. And the world's best have historically hidden their secrets. But with the arrival of the internet, the best of the best information is now available to all of us.

Moreover, technology is giving us some level of progress into being able to measure this state. HRV (Heart Rate Variability) training is proving to be an extremely powerful way of learning to trigger or "drop-in" to this state of flow at any moment. Other forms of biofeedback may also show promise.

When combined with an increasingly whole view of the human psyche, with contributions from both the East and West, we can make remarkable progress in this area in an extremely short period of time, and as such, quickly undergo a more stable transformation at the deepest level that ripples out into all areas of our lives.

Furthermore, the idea is not just to "wake up" in this way, as it's often called - but to be able to "stay awake" in the most trying of circumstances, in the deepest pain, with the largest circle of concern. We want to be open and free, and we want to be open and free everywhere - completely unobstructed.

So we start by getting the feel for "IT". Then we strengthen IT by challenging it in the presence of ever-increasing emotional, physical, mental and social complexity. Then we express in IT, yes by ourselves, but most importantly with others (group flow).

This is how we do the most "good" as well, how we are most useful. We typically find ourselves moving into a particular domain or skill that we are relatively obsessed with. When we do what we love, in a way that we love, we light ourselves on fire with a deep passion and love for life, for ourselves, and for everyone around us. We also become incredibly good at whatever it is we're doing, and usually do it in a uniquely authentic way, such that we are able to add genuine value to others.

In addition to living it yourself, leading by example, and infecting others around you with your joy and care, you may also feel inspired to share with others freely and fully - not from a place of guilt or lack, but from a place of genuine fulfilment and kindness, love, abundance. This does not just mean charitable donations etc. It means considering problems larger than yourself and making a sincere attempt to solve them, and/or to help others solve them. If you get creative enough, you can then align this with what you love, so that everything feeds into each other additively, and little is lost.

I summarize this as the "North Star" - currently: Unobstructed*, Connected, Organized Self-Expression - for I We All Life**

*(you could say that Unobstructed is comprised of Open and Complete, or Free and Full)

**(I We All Life points to the natural evolution and expansion of our circle of concern as we "handle" things at each step of the way)

The idea behind the North Star is that, if in doubt, you can use it to help you make difficult decisions. Does X lead to the North Star? And even moreso, you can set it as "the intention", i.e. the problem for your subconscious mind to solve, and then begin coming up with creative ideas and paths towards that. It helps turn all the theory into action.

This way, we're simultaneously living "IT", *and* helping others to live their version of "IT" too. We're at least *attempting* not to be hypocritcal / self-defeating. Hehe.

I've really just thrown this together for now - I intend to come back later and clean this up. There are many holes here, many unsupported assumptions, many parts needing clarification. The article series, including the "theory to practice" section, is simply a breakdown and "filling-out" of this
