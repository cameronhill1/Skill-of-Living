## Favourites / Recs

Here's a list of books, films, and other resources that have been particularly important for me, or that I think might be particularly useful and / or enjoyable for you.

Even if I don't agree with everything in all of them (and in some cases I haven't even read the full book), I've tried to select resources that I feel, together, constitute some of my current views and philosophy. As always, this will most likely change, and so I will probably update this list as time goes on.

Also, in my experience, it's not just about reading a "good book", but also about reading the _right_ good book at the _right_ time. Some books you pick up and you can't get through the first chapter, but then you read it 12 months later and it changes your life. And then you may recommend that book to a friend, and it may be old news for them.

So, I'm also giving little descriptions of why each book is here, what the general idea is, so you can get a better sense for what you might want to check out next (if anything).

A general note - there are a couple books directly about the ways of society (economics, politics, history, etc.), but not too many, as I feel they are covered very well indirectly in the other books here.

There's also a list of my favourite documentaries, films, series, anime, etc. at the bottom too. That's less about being Useful and more about being Beautiful / Fun :) - though I've found the line between the two to be quite blurry all throughout this page. I hope you find this to be true for you, as well. Happy living!

A final note: if you want my "top 10" or you're wondering where to start, here you go (see individual listings for descriptions): Awareness, The Art of Learning (and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r6gr7uytQA){:target="_blank"} interview), The Evolving Self, the Waking Up app, The Immunity Code, The Rise of Superman (and/or this [article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243047){:target="_blank"}, The Artist's Journey, Your Money or Your Life.



### Mindset/Learning (Happiness & Effectiveness)

- **The Art of Learning, Waitzkin** - If I could give you one book, I think it might be this one. Josh is what I would call a "serial master" - he has reached the highest levels of multiple completely unrelated pursuits (chess, t'ai chi push hands, brazillian jiu jitsu, and now standup paddle surfing), and focuses a fair amount on what he terms "thematic interconnectedness" - that beyond the unique technical elements of our individual disciplines and skills lies "the essence" of learning - and this learning transfers easily. At it's core, I think this "essence" is our depth of Presence / our sense of Quality, and our ability to maintain that in all kinds of situations and tensions.

- **The Talent Code + Little Book of Talent, Coyle** - The Talent Code is Daniel Coyle's first book I believe, and is profound. There are many books exploring mastery and learning, but I really like the way Coyle laid it out here, with some important and novel insights. I enjoy the focus on the mechanism of myelin that underlies learning, and how this supports a growth mindset. Helps you to get a better sense for your potential (and it's almost limitless potential). The Little Book of Talent is a short collection of 52 suggestions for applying these insights practically. Both are great.

- **Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu** - The translation is important, with Stephen Mitchell's being my personal favourite, and Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English's being more accurate (apparently)... Although I said my "If I could give you one book" was Josh Waitzkin's The Art of Learning, that was mainly because I think it's much more accessible for most people than the Tao Te Ching. I went through a (long) stage of reading something from this Tao Te Ching every day, simply because I wanted to keep only to the best inputs, and I could find nothing that could compare. It's essentially a collection of 81 short poems, or verses. You could read the whole thing comfortably in 20 minutes, though that doesn't do it justice... You could just as well spend a month, or a year, reading just a single verse. Each line seems to fill the heart with a lightness that seems hard to access elsewhere. Anyways, I'd highly recommend. You can download a Tao Te Ching app for free on the app store, with the translations I've recommended and a couple others too. Enjoy.

- **Awareness (audiobook), De Mello** - This is also a very strong contender for "if I could give you one (audio)book." For many people, this will be much more impactful than any other book on this list. Super funny, wonderful storytelling, masterful pointing to the Truth - and incredibly accessible for almost everyone. I now consider this to be at least on par with Eckhart Tolle's work as an introduction to "Presence" - though that doesn't mean it's just for beginners... the 20-year meditator is just as likely to benefit from and enjoy this one as the newbie.

- **7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Covey** - This is widely considered to be one of the most important books to be released in the "self-help" space, with over 25 million copies since its publication in 1989. Over the years, I have often found my ideas coming back around to closely reflect Covey's teachings and philosophy, and it's a book that I would probably do well to read more often! With no fluff, Covey suggests that there are timeless "principles" which we would do well as humans to align our "values" with - and then to live in alignment with those values. The 7 habits are both an exploration of those principles, and a practical guide on how to align ourselves with them. Highly recommended.

- **The War of Art + The Artist's Journey, Pressfield** - Both books are short, with pretty simple core concepts that explore from many different angles, so that you come away feeling very inspired and much more likely to start applying them in your life. The War of Art looks at our "Daemon", our Resistance to it, and how to reframe and overcome this Resistance. It's a really important book if you want to ever get anything of value done, I think. The Artist's Journey, although it covers Resistance, looks more at Art's place in our creative and spiritual lives. Among other things, he maps Joseph Campbell's work on the hero's journey onto that of an artists, both on the macro level, and on the micro level, giving a practical walkthrough of what it looks like to make Good art.

- **Power of Now + A New Earth, Tolle** - Although I think A New Earth is better, I think the Power of Now is a better introduction to "presence" and living with more conscious awareness. Both are classics that have changed millions of lives. If you think you're getting a bit stuck in "doing" and need to learn to chill out more into just "being", these are worth checking out.

- **Letting Go, Hawkins** - This was also a strong contender for "If I could just give you one book"... I talk (ha) a lot about "living it" as opposed to "talking about it". This book might help you make that transition more. Ironically, it explains the "letting go technique" itself so briefly that I (and most others I've recommended it to) missed it on the first time through. The rest of the book is essentially artfully aligning your intentions with applying it. I'm not sure on the "be all and end all" nature he seems to hint at with this technique - but as a part of an integrated solution, I think it's extremely powerful (and applying it lies at the core of much of my own development in recent years, I believe).

- **Integral Meditation, Wilber** - Speaking of an "integrated solution", who better to bring up next than the father of Integral theory himself, Ken Wilber. I love this man - he is an extremely deep soul, and I think that his contributions over the past 40-50 years are perhaps some of the most important we've had (at least from what I've seen). I'd invite you to check out his other stuff as well, but Integral Meditation is a lovely primer on some of the most important elements of the Integral movement, explored both theoretically and practically, with reference to life's most important areas.

- **Release the Brakes, Newman** - This is a wonderful, classic "mindset" book. Jim Newman takes us from theory to practice as he explores the human operating system, its  primary limitations, and the limitless potential that arises when we release ourselves from those limitations. A book that flew under the majority of the "self-helpers'" radars, I believe.

- **The Body Keeps the Score, Van der Kolk** - A wonderful companion to the last few books, neuroscientist Van der Kolk rounds up his experience from 3-4 decades of being the leading edge of trauma research. In other words, he provides a scientific basis to much of what has been discussed in the above books. After dispelling the myth that trauma work is only for sufferers of intense, acute trauma, he goes on to explore the mechanisms of trauma and more importantly, our adaptation to it (in children and adults), and finishes with some practical suggestions for treatment.

- **How To Change Your Mind, Pollan** - Incidentally, one of the best strategies emerging for healing trauma, both acute and chronic, seems to be psychedelic-assisted therapy. The reason why we're so resistant to change, and why PTSD sufferers are so resistant to standard treatment, is rigidity. The painful feelings of helplessness that we've repressed and buried deep down are usually defended by years and often decades of learned avoidance mechanisms and physical, muscular "armouring". We become hardened; calcified. In How To Change Your Mind, Michael Pollan shows us the incredible power of psychedelics to bust through this rigidity in record time. If you'd like to watch a powerful documentary on this, check out "Trip of Compassion" in the misc. resources below.

- **Flow, Csikszentmihalyi** - ...Or perhaps something by Steven Kotler. "Flow" is the book that presents the original research on flow state psychology and launched a movement, and Kotler is at the forefront of that movement 2-3 decades later. Stealing Fire is supposed to be a good one, though I have not read it - I thoroughly enjoyed his free e-book on his site though! Very practical, very deep, and I can highly recommend (that's where I first saw the "flow cycle", and later started making connections and seeing how its 4 stages were quite fundamental to many aspects of the human experience).

- **The New Toughness Training For Sports, Loehr** - I read this one when I was 16 or so, when looking for anything that could give me an edge in rugby. Really helped to drill in the importance of "flicking the switch" on and off with intensity, rather than drift somewhere in between. And the harder you switch it on, the harder you can switch it off... AND vice versa - the harder you switch off, the more you can switch it on when it's showtime.

- **Waking Up, app by Sam Harris** - A fantastic introduction to actually PRACTICING the essence of all of the above. Use it as much as you can.

- **Udemy, Coursera, EdX, Masterclass and other online course sites** - learn anything you want, online! And [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY){:target="_blank"} how to do it fast.

So these books will give you a pretty good head start on most everything in life, I'd imagine... They kinda feed into everything else, from health to relationships to work and business, because they hit the essence... That being said, here are some additional recs...


### Human nature, life

- **Laws of Human Nature, Greene** - In my opinion, Robert Greene is such a fantastic writer (and researcher). His work over the past couple decades has all been centred around human behaviour and excellence... and this book is the Master's comprehensive guide to the human OS, with all its flaws and leverage points.

- **Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl** - Victor Frankl was a holocaust survivor. He observed that most people lost hope and the will to live, and that these were usually the next to pass. He started to form his own horror-tested interpretation of an existential philosophy, which then formed the basis of "logotherapy", or helping people to heal and grow through shifting the meaning associated with difficult or traumatics events in our lives. "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way." Apart from being extremely practically useful, it's incredibly inspiring.

- **The Perennial Philosophy, Huxley** - I haven't actually read all of this one (I started, but it seemed a bit dense and felt I already got the idea), but many others have talked extensively about this (eg. Alan Watts, Ken Wilber), and I use this concept a lot, so I figured I'd put this here if you'd like to see it explored more deeply. When we talk of "the perennial philosophy", we're referring to the essential, common, golden thread at the core of all the world's great traditions and religions. Over the centuries, 4 main methods of scriptural interpretation (see ["hermeneutics"](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hermeneutics-principles-of-biblical-interpretation){:target="_blank"} have emerged: literal, moral, allegorical, and anagogical/inspirational. When interpreting the great traditions' texts literally or morally, their messages seem to differ and oppose one another ("My God, not your God" and "My path, not your path"). But when we look more deeply into the texts (allegorical and inspirational interpretations), we see that they are pointing towards the same Truth, and are all systems of theory, practice, and community, birthed from varied cultures around the globe, with the intention of helping to liberate humans from suffering. We're all in this together.

- **The Hero With A Thousand Faces, Campbell** - Also great is the audio/video series he did with Bill Moyers titled "The Power of Myth" - Related to the perennial philosophy discussed above, Joseph Campbell found through a lifetime of work in mythology that the vast majority of our stories and scriptures passed down through the ages contained the same basic structure, which he termed the "hero's journey". With three main stages: departure, initiation, and return, it has become an internalized blueprint for master storytellers all over. This is well accompanied by [this interesting Ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tomas_pueyo_why_stories_captivate?language=en){:target="_blank"}.

- **On The Shortness of Life, Seneca** - The tagline says it all: "Life is long if you know what to do with it." This wasn't particularly impactful for me when I read it, but I think it's an important counterpoint to the common complaint that "life is short". It's only short if you waste it, if you live it as if you had all the time in the world. It's eternal if you accept death and relax fully into this moment.

- **Psychology of Human Misjudgement, Munger** - [PDF](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ca3e714d74562b554c38604/t/5caa07a9971a182374badc19/1554646956708/Psychology+of+Human+Misjudgment.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws){:target="_blank"} - Charlie Munger is the business partner of Warren Buffet, and an incredibly intelligent guy. He considers this subject to be one of, if not *the* most important subjects to learn well - that of the psychology of human misjudgement, of learning the ways that we're most susceptible to be wrong. As he says, "All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there." If we become aware of our weaknesses, we can start try to correct for them. This speech is a fantastic intro to some of the different cognitive biases common to all of us.

- **Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman** - ...And this book is the culmination of decades of work on the same subject by Nobel prize-winner Daniel Kahneman.

- **Farnam Street** - A wonderful blog on cultivating wisdom and critical thinking. Check out their *awesome* core principles [here](https://fs.blog/principles/){:target="_blank"} and their *fantastic* collection of mental models [here](https://fs.blog/mental-models/){:target="_blank"}

- **Thinking in Bets?, Duke** - Haven't read this one (yet), though she covers an important bias; causal reductionism. Our brains tend to simplify things to "if I make a good decision, something good will happen" and "if something goes wrong following my decision, it must have been a good decision." But this is not the case - there are many factors at play, including seemingly random chance, and so it's possible to get good results from bad decisions, and vice versa. Understanding this helps us to move into probabilistic thinking, which is useful both for learning from past decisions, and becoming comfortable with the inevitable uncertainty and tension of making present decisions.

- **The Evolving Self?, Kegan** - I haven't read this one, but am otherwise familiar with Kegan's work, and this seems to be the best one to start with. Leading Harvard adult developmental psychologist Robert Kegan presents a wonderful model of evolution in humans that parallels nicely with those of many other schools of thought (eg. integral, spiral dynamics, Maslow's hierarchy of needs...). He suggests that we move from Opportunistic, to Socialized, to Self-authoring, and then to Self-transformative, and explores the limitations of the socialized self. Also great is his "Immunity to Change", which simply lays out what gets in the way of transforming for most people - namely, the fear of experiencing negative feelings such as shame and disappointment - and presents a simple method for navigating the rocky terrain.

- **Stumbling on Happiness, Gilbert** - In this one, Dan Gilbert (another Harvard psychologist) explores a few of these cognitive biases in detail to explain why we're so bad at predicting what will make us happy. He concludes that we should trust ourselves less in this department, and ask people who have been through what it is that we're considering - how do they feel? This can save us years of wasted effort - it is said that the worst thing in life is not to miss out on what you want, but to get it and realize that it's not what you wanted. So, let's make an active effort to look at the happiest people in the world, and see how they live.

- **The Happiness Hypothesis, Haidt** - So how do the happiest people in the world live? Turns out we've been studying happiness and suffering for thousands of years. Jonathan Haidt reviews the ancient wisdom from our great traditions and philosophers, and couples the findings with more modern research to produce his "hypothesis on happiness".

- **The 6 Pillars of Self-Esteem, Branden** - This is the seminal work on self-esteem, from what I've seen. I think the concept of self-esteem, and the way in which it's explored here, is extremely all-pervasive, permeating all aspects of life. Nathaniel Branden was Ayn Rand's lover for a while, and she considered him to be the living embodiment of her work (she based the character John Galt on him). So, if you'd like a fiction book or two with many examples of characters *living* these ideas, then you may enjoy Atlas Shrugged and/or The Fountainhead.

- **Hell Yeah or No, Sivers** - Fantastic book - I love Derek's writing style. An intelligently organized collection of short essays on updating identity, making things happen, changing perspective, what's worth doing, fixing faulty thinking, saying no, and saying yes.

- **The Vital Question, Lane** - Nick Lane asks the question "Why has life evolved the way it has?", and points to energy (availability, efficiency) as the answer.

- **Why Information Grows?, Hidalgo** - Hidalgo explores how information "spins up" exponentially.

- **Gödel, Escher, Bach? + I Am A Strange Loop?, Hofstadter** - Hofstadter draws on many disparate sources and fields to present his main idea: that consciousness, the feeling of being a self, is the result of many neurones firing and coordinating together (in ways we're not yet 100% clear on).

- **The User Illusion, Nørretranders** - Nørretranders uses the idea of the "user illusion" from computers (the illusion that there is a desktop etc., rather than just a graphical interface layed on top of code and hardware) as an analogy to suggest that we are also living a user illusion - that perhaps there is no "self" in the way that we typically tend to think of it.

- **Reasons and Persons, Parfit** - This is a powerful philosophy / morality / ethics book, with a central theme of "impersonality" and its implications.

- **The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck, Manson** - Also check out his blog (MM.net I believe). One of my favourite writers, Mark has a knack for cutting through the noise and delivering clean signal, in a humorous way - this book is a great one for reassessing your priorities in life and loosening up a little - and is a very fun listen on audiobook.

- **Integral Psychology?, Wilber** - I haven't read this one, but if you're looking for a deeper introduction into Wilber's work and Integral theory (following on from Integral Meditation), then this may be worth checking out.

- **Iron John, Bly** - Some people may not vibe with this book like I did, but this one changed me big time. I remember a rare week of complete seclusion and isolation a few years ago where I read this book, took a LOT of notes, and meditated on and built out those notes thoroughly. This, along with a couple other books and films, helped me to start making the shift from seeking success outside of me to turning within and going deep. Robert Bly tells the tale of Iron John wth extensive commentary to demonstrate the classic path of male development, of initiation, of going from boy to man. A lot of it also applies to women, but this one's directed at men.

- **King, Warrior, Magician, Lover, Gillette and Moore** - This one is another powerful book along the same lines, and I've been amazed at how many times I've seen parallels for this model cropping up all over the place. The general idea presented by these two Neo-Jungian psychologists is that, in the balanced and mature male psyche, there are 4 particularly important archetypes (patterns of being) that assist and balance each other: The King, the Warrior, the Magician, and the Lover. They each have a balanced expression, as well as the two polarities of imbalanced (shadow) expression. Love it.

- **The Obstacle is the Way?, Holiday** - I have only been through summaries of this (as I was already pretty familiar with Stoic philosophy), but apparently this is a great introduction, and I've seen nothing to suggest otherwise. The title alone is incredibly powerful. Another great one on Stoic philosophy - Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. That's a beautiful one.

- **The Impersonal Life, Benner** - Let me warn you that this one is not for everyone. Originally published in 1914, this is an intensely "spiritual" book... It's pretty short, and it's written in a strange style, but it is essentially one constant pointer to who you are... and who you're not.

- **Sapiens, Harari** - Everyone raves about this one. Yuval Noah Harari follows the path of evolution of our species over the past couple hundred thousand years, and shows that perhaps the key driver for human evolution was the development of complex language that unlocked the ability to weave narratives that, in turn, allowed us to cooperate extremely effectively in progressively larger and larger groups. He goes on to give examples of these narratives (like money), and shows us that they can be incredibly useful, but also harmful if we don't choose the right narratives and we don't do it consciously. Incidentally, Yuval regularly knocks out 30-100 day meditation retreats, and has done 2 hours of vipassana pretty much every day since he was 19 or so. You can tell in his writing - it's super clear, sharp, exquisite.

- **Lessons of History, Durant and Durant** - Will & Ariel Durant co-wrote many books on human history of all kinds. I think you'll get a lot of history from other books here, but if you want one explicitly on history, this is my recommendation - a little 100-150 page book that pulls the lessons together beautifully.

- **JP's Hero's Journey** - an audio course on SoundsTrue from JP Sears. I think this is really well put together, and found it super beneficial to go through. Great value for money.

- **Work of Eric Thomas, Elliott Hulse, Brian Tracy, Tony Robbins, Earl Nightingale, Owen Cook** - I have to give these guys a shout out. Although I'm not including their books here, they all played an important role in my formative years. Eric is a motivational speaker (sparked something in me aged 13 or so), Elliott is a weightlifting spiritualist / philosopher, Brian is a classic name in personal development, Tony's pretty much a household name in the same area, I hear Earl almost founded modern personal development as we know it (his Direct Line series was incredibly powerful for me when I was 16/17), and Owen is a dating / social dynamics / personal development teacher (with some great long-form video content on YouTube). If you feel called to explore any of their work in more detail, I'd encourage you to do so.

### Health

- **The Immunity Code, Greene** - I've read many books and articles on health and nutrition over the years - and this has been the most transformative for me. A relatively new book (released 6 months ago at the time of writing this) and originally titled "Peak Human", Joel Greene attempts to establish a new paradigm in the health and weight loss space. It's heavy on science, but you'll come away with a list of actionable steps and "hacks" that you can use to rapidly level up to the highest echelons of *real* human health. There's a massive focus on gut health and sleep here, and as someone who has struggled *a lot* with both of these over the years, I can vouch for it from experience.

- **How To Eat, Move, and Be Healthy, Chek** - I (and many others) consider Paul Chek to be pretty much the forefront of health and rehabilitation when viewed from a holistic perspective (as it should be). This is his gift to the world.

- **What Doesn't Kill Us, Carney and Hof** - WAKE UP! We've become incredibly soft as a species. Scott Carney looks at the power of the cold, the breath, and extreme altitude with Wim Hof to show us we've lost our evolutionary "edge" - and how to get it back.

-**XPT (app)** - From Laird Hamilton and Gabby Reece, XPT (eXtreme Performance Training) is based on the principles of "Breathe, Move, Recover", and their app has some fantastic breath training work. Highly recommended as a companion for the above book.

- **Boundless, Greenfield** - Another HEAVY book (it's like an encyclopedia), this one is very exhaustive and thorough, and is the result of a couple decades of research and experimentation by the renowned biohacker Ben Greenfield. Super impressive and an incredibly useful reference guide.

- **Why We Sleep, Walker** - So apparently he exaggerated with some of the research in here, but it's still a great book. He shows us how integral sleep is to performing and feeling well, and then shows us what usually gets in the way of good sleep, and how to fix it.

- **Foundation Training (app)** - Their membership site could well be the best $15/month you'll ever spend. Profound for improving posture, healing yourself from back pain, and steadily repatterning trauma. A great way to start the morning. They have a 14-week periodized introductory course, put together by the master himself, Dr. Eric Goodman... and it's great fun!

### Music

This is a tough one man. I listen to a lot of good music, from pretty much all genres and time periods - after all, Good music is Good music. Most of us nowadays stick pretty closely to a couple genres, and usually only the most recent stuff... I'd just say, try exploring a bit more. Check out a Top 100 albums list from a reputable source like Mojo or Rolling Stones magazine, and see if there's anything there that grabs your fancy. And so too with more current artists - there are a lot of incredible indie and smaller artists out there that are on par with or surpassing the top dogs, but just don't have the recognition. That being said, here are a few [favourites](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5AUo7wHNVR0qSfGr3akeEI?si=YRxr2XoMTDqtN6xCy4XG1w){:target="_blank"} (Spotify).
