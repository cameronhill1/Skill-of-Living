## Favourites / Recs

Here's a list of books, films, and other resources that have been particularly important for me, or that I think might be particularly important for you.

Even if I don't agree with everything in all of them (and in some cases I haven't even read the full book), I've tried to select resources that I feel, together, constitute some of my current views and philosophy. As always, this will most likely change, and I will probably update this list as time goes on.

Also, it's not just about reading a "good book" in my experience, but also about reading the right good book at the right time. Some books you pick up and can't get through the first chapter, and you read it 12 months later and it changes your life. And then you may recommend that book to a friend, and it may be old news for them.

So, I'm also giving little descriptions of why each book is here, so you can get a better sense for what you might want to check out next (if anything).

There's also a list of my favourite documentaries, animes, films, etc. At the bottom too. That's less about being Useful and more about being Beautiful / Fun - though the line between the two is quite blurry throughout this page. I hope you find this to be true, as well.



### Mindset/Learning (Happiness & Effectiveness)

- The Art of Learning, Waitzkin - 

- The Talent Code + Little Book of Talent, Coyle - 

- Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu - 

- The War of Art + The Artist's Journey, Pressfield - 

- Power of Now + A New Earth, Tolle - 

- Letting Go, Hawkins - 

- Integral Meditation, Wilber - (inc. a note about how all of his stuff is great)

- Release the Brakes, Newman - 

- The Body Keeps the Score, Van der Kolk - 

- Flow, Csikszentmihalyi - Or perhaps something by Steven Kotler. "Flow" is the book that represent the original research on Flow state psychology and launched a movement, and Kotler is at the forefront of exploring that movement 2-3 decades later. Stealing Fire is supposed to be a good one, though I have not read it - I thoroughly enjoyed his free e-book on his site though. Very practical, very deep, I'd highly recommend (that's where I got the "flow cycle" from, and later saw how it was quite important).

They'll give you a pretty good head start on most everything in life, I'd imagine... They kinda feed into everything else, from health to relationships to work and business... That being said, here are some additional recs...


### Human nature, life

- Laws of Human Nature, Greene - 

- Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl - 

- Psychology of Human Misjudgement, Munger - [here's a video link to the speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws){:target="_blank"}

- The Evolving Self?, Kegan - 

- Why Information Grows?, Hidalgo - 

- Gödel, Escher, Bach?, Hofstadter - 

- The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck, Manson - Also check out his blog (MM.net I believe). One of my favourite writers, has a knack for cutting through the noise and delivering clean signal - this book is a great one for reassessing your priorities in life and loosening up a little - and is a very fun listen on audiobook.

- Integral Psychology?, Wilber

- Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman - 

- Iron John, Bly - 

- The Obstacle is the Way?, Holiday - I have only been through summaries of this (as I was already pretty familiar with Stoic philosophy), but apparently this is a great introduction, and I've seen nothing to suggest otherwise. The title alone is incredibly powerful. Another great one on Stoic philosophy - Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. That's a beautiful one.

- The Impersonal Life, Benner - Let me warn you that this one is not for everyone. Originally published in 1914, this is an intensely "spiritual" book... It's pretty short, and it's written in a strange style, but it is essentially one constant pointer to who you are... and who you're not.

- See some of the fiction recommendations too for this section...
