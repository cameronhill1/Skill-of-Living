Life is kinda weird, don't you think?

Just the other day, I was remarking to my mum how strange it is, giving the example of frying eggs.

I pointed to the eggs I was frying, and as I cracked another, I said something like:

"I mean, look at this. Inside this fragile little shell (*crack*), it's gooey and transparent. Kinda weird...

... But then it gets weirder. As you cook it, it turns white!"

And then we take that goo and put it in our bellies and make sounds that refer to this process as "eating eggs"...

And we never question any of it.

Meanwhile, we're a bunch of (slightly) more evolved chimps (we call ourselves Homo Sapiens, or "Wise Man in Latin...)

Spinning on a round lump of rock (that we call Earth)

in a black expanse of mostly-nothingness (that we refer to as "space").

Most of us never really question THAT, either.

And yet we hold fast to our opinions on everything from "the X to Y...

But do we even know what we're doing here?

It's easy to get caught up and lost in the day to day monotonies of life in our society today...

And never ask the big questions, never really question the way things are...

I think, when I look at my own tendency to shy away from these big questions, from questioning beliefs I've held for a long time...

I notice a couple consistent, underlying reasons or themes:

First - Too tired, can't think straight, stressed with other concerns and challenges that are perhaps a little more urgent, even a belief that you can't think for yourself because you're dumb -> A feeling of being physically and/or mentally unable to slice through the tough stuff

Second - Afraid of imagined negative consequences of questioning a belief we've held onto for a while -> 
Eg. Christianity / belief in God when I was 11 or so. I remember thinking about questioning it by looking at the evidence for and against, and feeling afraid - of angering God if He was real, of separating myself from my mum's religion and beliefs... and I remember realizing - if it's true, I have nothing to fear, because I'll question it and I'll come back to the truth. If it's not true, then I've just saved myself a lot of pain and delusion and heartache. (after that, atheist for a bit, then agnostic). Not saying Christianity is not true, I personally think there's a LOT of good in Christianity, as well as in most other religions too. The events in the texts could also have literally happened, although I think it's a little more doubtful, but ultimately I don't know, I wasn't there.

And in fact, I'd suggest that they're somewhat related. If we break fear down<sup>1</sup>, we can see that it's not only the anticipation that "X bad thing will happen", but also that __we won't be able to handle it.__ 

Health, and not buying into the shame... (opportunistic, socialized self (with conformity and unquestionable beliefs), to self-authoring, self-transformative...) - you can.

If there's just one thing I'd have you consider, it's the value of not knowing, of questioning everything, including and perhaps especially yourself.

I don't have the answers, but I hope I might be able to help you ask yourself some useful questions.

So with all that being said...
