### Start here (work in progress)

Life is kinda weird, don't you think?

Just the other day, I was remarking to my mum how strange it is, giving the example of frying eggs.

I pointed to the eggs I was frying, and as I cracked another, I said something like:

"I mean, look at this. Inside this fragile little shell (*crack*), it's gooey and transparent. Kinda weird...

... But then it gets weirder. As you cook it, it turns white!"

And then we take that goo and put it in our bellies and make sounds that refer to this process as "eating eggs"...

And we never question any of it.

Meanwhile, we're a bunch of (slightly) more evolved "chimps" (we call ourselves Homo Sapiens, or "Wise Man" in Latin)...

Spinning on a round lump of rock (that we call Earth)...

in a black expanse<sup>0</sup> of mostly-nothingness (that we refer to as "space").

Most of us never really question THAT, either. In fact, we tend not to question things much at all. (At least, considering how weird they are).

And when we _do_ ask questions, they tend to relate to playing the game better (eg. "How can I get X to like me?", and "How can I make more money?"), rather than questioning the game itself (let alone the player).

Instead, we tend to move through life, most of the time, with rigid certainty, holding fast to our opinions on everything from our religion, our politics, and our morality, to our diet, our fashion, and our sense of self.

But how can we be so certain about these topics, when we don't even know what we're doing here?<sup>0.5</sup>

It's easy to get caught up and lost in the day to day monotonies of our life in society... and never really ask the big questions, never really question the way things are.

**So that's the purpose of this site... To embrace the beautiful mystery of not knowing as a foundation, to rebuild from there with some (hopefully) independent thinking to find what's most important, and to experiment (together) in finding the best ways to live in alignment with that thinking.**

I'm not sure on the format that this will take - I have ideas, and some kind of a plan, but we'll see how it unfolds and changes over time. Don't worry though, it'll be obvious at each step of the journey as to what's happening next.<sup>0.75</sup>

Before we get into it, there are a couple things that seem useful and fairly important to discuss briefly:

#1 - So far, we've talked a lot about questioning things. But is this even a good thing? Is it important to know what's important, "true"? What if we're 100% right, or even just "mostly" right about everything already - wouldn't that be a relative waste of our time and attention? Wouldn't our efforts be better spent elsewhere - like on taking action and on living in alignment with our answers?

(Circular, as these are questions)

+ I could say that of course, otherwise we're ignorant... But ultimately, I don't know - I don't think you can know until you start thinking about what's important / true, and even then, you're probably on shaky, circular ground. So perhaps it's not important. Perhaps it is. Either way, at least for me personally (and I'm guessing that, if you've read this far, you're probably similar), I seem to have a tendency for curiosity, to ask questions and learn and discover my blindspots, to try and make sense of things and find meaning. I can partly ignore or suppress this "drive", but that doesn't make it go away... it's still there. It seems that most humans share this drive to some extent. 

I also think (and I'll discuss this more later), that this may ultimately be a necessary-but-temporary stepping stone to be "transcended-and-included", that perhaps there is no "meaning of life" in the way we tend to think of it, and that there is a lot of benefit to be had in just "letting go" and just "being", even in the midst of our doing.

Which partly answers the last couple questions above, too... Let me be clear that, although the emphasis so far has been on asking more questions, I think answers, and acting on those answers are at least as important (see the bolded "purpose of this site" above). Rather than a continuous questioning (where nothing ever gets done), or continuous action (where the more "important" things rarely get done), I'd suggest an intuitive<sup>0.8</sup> balance between the two is most useful - quality action, periodically interspersed with questioning and re-evaluating our direction; moving forwards, and course correcting.

Again, ultimately, I think we can approach a kind of synthesis of the two - where the boundary between question, answer, and action, between uncertainty, certainty, and expression, becomes so fluid and immediate that it seems to blur and fade altogether. However, I think that it's a process, and we probably don't start there. We start with asking questions, coming up with some answers, and testing those answers with action.

Finally, I'll add that the reason I'm emphasizing questions initially is because it seems to be relatively lacking today. We have lots of answers, and lots of action, but much less uncertainty and question-asking. We too often turn away from that intuitive sense of unease that wants us to examine it and put ourselves on the "right" path again. If we play this out on an individual level over the course of years, or even decades, we find that we've lived a life that hasn't been true to ourselves and has been relatively devoid of "meaning" - at which point we're consumed by a mid-life crisis, or worse, deathbed regrets<sup>0.9</sup>. If we play this out on a collective level over the course of a generation or two, we find ourselves with too much power and intelligence, and not enough wisdom to guide it. So I think it's fairly important.

So this leads me to the second topic worth discussing at this point...

#2 - If it's so important, why do we turn away? Why do we fail to ask the deeper questions? What gets in the way? And how can we remove these obstacles?

Rather than being an absolute thing, I think it's more of a spectrum or sliding scale, where we all ask these deeper questions _sometimes_, and shy away from them at others. It's just a question, of how much of each, and why? If we understand what causes us to lean towards one or the other, we can begin to tip the scales towards a healthy, courageous curiosity


Positive vs negative expected outcome... 







 Why not go with the flow?  quickly shove them out of your mind... I'll think about it later... But before you know it, you're either having a mid-life crisis and you're regretting the lost time (best time to start is now, not too late, longevity escape velocity, and finish well - we remember it how we finish, the ending gives it the meaning), or you're on your deathbed (5 regrets of the dying, zoom out and make sure you're looking at the right things) (and then it may be a bit late, although you can still make some changes / accept some things and finish well). Regret minimization. Rigidity as downfall, lack of adaptability. And A = A, just because you don't look at it, doesn't mean it's not real.


 We act with such presence that it's apparently with the utmost certainty, and yet we're continually and automatically re-evaluating the situation, completely open and ready to do a 180 at any moment).

When I look at my own tendency to shy away from these big questions, from questioning beliefs I've held for a long time... I notice a couple of consistent, underlying themes that come up:
*
First - Too tired, can't think straight, stressed with other concerns and challenges that are perhaps a little more urgent, even a belief that you can't think for yourself because you're dumb -> A feeling of being physically and/or mentally unable to slice through the tough stuff

Second - The fear of not knowing, being uncertain, not being in control, Afraid of imagined negative consequences of questioning a belief we've held onto for a while -> 
Eg. Christianity / belief in God when I was 11 or so. I remember thinking about questioning it by looking at the evidence for and against, and feeling afraid - of angering God if He was real, of separating myself from my mum's religion and beliefs, of being wrong / sunk cost fallacy, of not knowing (bias of needing certainty to act)... and I remember realizing - if it's true, I have nothing to fear, because I'll question it and I'll come back to the truth. If it's not true, then I've just saved myself a lot of pain and delusion and heartache. (after that, atheist for a bit, then agnostic). Not saying Christianity is not true, I personally think there's a LOT of good in Christianity, as well as in most other religions too. The events in the texts could also have literally happened, although I think it's a little less likely, but ultimately I don't know, I wasn't there.





And in fact, I'd suggest that they're somewhat related. If we break fear down<sup>1</sup>, we can see that it's not only the anticipation that "X bad thing will happen", but _also_ that _we won't be able to handle it._ 

Health, and not buying into the shame...  -> know that you can, don't buy into it, it's just actions, habits, skills, it can all be learned, the body is renewed completely each year, the mind can transform radically, the soul? You are not defective... You are beautiful as you are, and you are capable of so much... I truly believe that, believe in you, the potential of humans... 

If there's just one thing I'd have you consider, it's the value of not knowing, of questioning everything, including and perhaps especially yourself.

I don't have the answers, but I hope I might be able to help you ask yourself some useful questions.

So with all that being said, let's start taking a look at the fun stuff...!

### What do we want, why, and what gets in the way?

Before we can figure out "how" to hit the target (or get close), we first need to know what we're aiming for (or have a good guess, at least).<sup>2</sup>

It appears to me that there are a few ways we could go about this:

1. We could follow our desires, aversions, and emotions - both those that can be satisfied in the short-term, and those requiring longer-term, more strategic pursuit.

2. We could come up with ideas, stories, and beliefs - based partly on our experiences, and partly on those of others - and follow their conclusions.

3. We could attempt to use reason, rationality, and experimentation to find one or more thing(s) to aim at.

4. We could affirm our direct experience, our intuition, and the sense of "just knowing", and follow that.

5. We could use a combination of the above - perhaps the "rightness" of a method depends on the circumstances and the user (although one method would need to be used to decide which to use in which contexts).

6. We could realize that, since we can now see, with the benefit of hindsight, that we have had blindspots in the past that led us to following something that was less than ideal, it is highly probably that we CURRENTLY also have blindspots and are following something less than ideal... And so we could discard absolutes and finalities of right and wrong, true and false - and we could instead adopt a _spectrum_ of truth (with everything being true to some extent, and some things being more true than others), and we could resolve to do our best with what we believe to be true in any moment, while remaining completely open to being "wrong", and ready at any moment to discard the old for the new.

7. We could fail to consider this matter altogether (either deliberately or unconsciously), and end up "accidentally" using some kind of combination of the above (and/or something else we've missed).

8. Similar to 7, we could declare that there's no point trying to aim for anything (however we arrive at that conclusion).

Now let's run through them, look at them as a whole, and try to make some sense out of this...

*NB - before we go any further, let me be clear that it's quite probable that I'm missing something here. If so, please fill me in, and I can adjust it for all of our benefit. These are questions that mankind has grappled with for millenia, and I'm by no means suggesting that I have all the answers. Just a few ideas and thought experiments.


(Opportunistic - pain vs. pleasure, Socialized - shame vs. pride, Self-authoring** - self-betrayal vs. self-esteem, Self-transformative** - unnecessary vs. unobstructed & connected self-expression)
(Archaic, Magic, Magic-Mythic, Mythic-Literal, Rational, Pluralistic, Integral, Unity...)

(I believe there IS a difference, and an important one at that, between the emotions of #1 and the intuition of #4.)

(NB - 7 is behind the obliviousness consciousness... And partly why consciousness/awareness is important)













Footnotes

0 - By volume, the Earth is supposedly 5.539108e+82 times smaller than the known universe. And for most of us, most of our daily concerns are not even worldcentric, but "egocentric", and maybe "social-circle-centric". [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy7NzjCmUf0){:target="_blank"} is pretty cool and puts things in perspective.

0.5 - Sure, there's the big bang, or maybe this is a virtual reality, or maybe a God created it... But where could _these_ things have come from in the first place? If you really let yourself ponder this, you can have some pretty deep realizations (or perhaps, un-realizations), and a sense of deep wonder can arise.

0.75 - note to self, possibly include a brief overview / current outline here too (and remove menu at the top, apart from Tl;dr, and put it at the end of the series, perhaps)

0.8 - For me, the intuitive sense here literally feels like a "going the wrong way", "wasting effort" kinda vibe. And I feel a kind of subtle "knowing" that I'd benefit from pausing (despite the inertia), taking a step back (or 10), and remaining open long enough to find a better path.

0.9 - Regrets of the dying, #1

1 - "Feel The Fear and Do It Anyway" by Susan Jeffers explores this breakdown a bit more deeply.

2 - And not to trip you out too much, but really, before _that_ we need to know, Who is it that's doing the aiming and shooting? And Who is it that's asking these questions? But yeah, more on that later. Hehe :)



****


In 2, with the paradoxes, can mention how we pointed before to the essential nature of dealing with them - both, a spectrum, transcend and include, both true, one is more...
