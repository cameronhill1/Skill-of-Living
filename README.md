### Start here

Life is kinda weird, don't you think?

Just the other day, I was remarking to my mum how strange it is, giving the example of frying eggs.

I pointed to the eggs I was frying, and as I cracked another, I said something like:

"I mean, look at this. Inside this fragile little shell (*crack*), it's gooey and transparent. Kinda weird...

... But then it gets weirder. As you cook it, it turns white!"

And then we take that goo and put it in our bellies and make sounds that refer to this process as "eating eggs"...

And we never question any of it.

Meanwhile, we're a bunch of (slightly) more evolved chimps (we call ourselves Homo Sapiens, or "Wise Man in Latin...)

Spinning on a round lump of rock (that we call Earth)

in a black expanse of mostly-nothingness (that we refer to as "space").

Most of us never really question THAT, either.

And yet we hold fast to our opinions on everything from our religion and our political stance to our diet and our philosophical perspectives.

But do we even know what we're doing here?

It's easy to get caught up and lost in the day to day monotonies of life in our society today... and never really ask the big questions, never really question the way things are.

- Is it good to question it? Why not go with the flow? Could be fine, except if we're honest with ourselves we sense that something's there that wants to be looked at, but then we turn away... Not talking about these articles, but about thoughts you have - quickly shove them out of your mind... I'll think about it later... But before you know it, you're either having a mid-life crisis and you're regretting the lost time (best time to start is now, not too late, longevity escape velocity, and finish well - we remember it how we finish, the ending gives it the meaning), or you're on your deathbed (and then it may be a bit late, although you can still make some changes / accept some things and finish well). Regret minimization.

And I don't think that it's an absolute thing either. I think we all ask these questions to __some__ extent, and shy away from them to some extent. It's just a question of, how much of each, and what influences us to lead towards one or the other. If we understand that, we can begin to tip the scales towards a more courageous and healthy curiosity.

I think, when I look at my own tendency to shy away from these big questions, from questioning beliefs I've held for a long time...

I notice a couple consistent, underlying reasons or themes:

First - Too tired, can't think straight, stressed with other concerns and challenges that are perhaps a little more urgent, even a belief that you can't think for yourself because you're dumb -> A feeling of being physically and/or mentally unable to slice through the tough stuff

Second - Afraid of imagined negative consequences of questioning a belief we've held onto for a while -> 
Eg. Christianity / belief in God when I was 11 or so. I remember thinking about questioning it by looking at the evidence for and against, and feeling afraid - of angering God if He was real, of separating myself from my mum's religion and beliefs, of being wrong / sunk cost fallacy, of not knowing (bias of needing certainty to act)... and I remember realizing - if it's true, I have nothing to fear, because I'll question it and I'll come back to the truth. If it's not true, then I've just saved myself a lot of pain and delusion and heartache. (after that, atheist for a bit, then agnostic). Not saying Christianity is not true, I personally think there's a LOT of good in Christianity, as well as in most other religions too. The events in the texts could also have literally happened, although I think it's a little more doubtful, but ultimately I don't know, I wasn't there.

And in fact, I'd suggest that they're somewhat related. If we break fear down<sup>1</sup>, we can see that it's not only the anticipation that "X bad thing will happen", but also that __we won't be able to handle it.__ 

Health, and not buying into the shame...  -> know that you can, don't buy into it, it's just actions, habits, skills, it can all be learned, the body is renewed completely each year, the mind can transform radically, the soul? You are not defective... You are beautiful as you are, and you are capable of so much... I truly believe that, believe in you, the potential of humans... 

If there's just one thing I'd have you consider, it's the value of not knowing, of questioning everything, including and perhaps especially yourself.

I don't have the answers, but I hope I might be able to help you ask yourself some useful questions.

So with all that being said...

### What do we want, why, and what gets in the way?

Before we can figure out "how" to hit the target (or get close), we first need to know what we're aiming for (or have a good guess, at least).<sup>2</sup>

It appears to me that there are a few ways we could go about this:

1. We could follow our desires and wants and aversions on a whim, as they arise - we could follow our emotions.

2. We could come up with ideas, stories, and beliefs - based partly on our experiences, and partly on those of others - and follow their conclusions.

3. We could attempt to use reason, rationality, and experimentation to find one or more thing(s) to aim at.

4. We could affirm our direct experience, our intuition, and the sense of "just knowing", and follow that.

5. We could use a combination of the above - perhaps the "rightness" of a method depends on the circumstances (although one method would need to be used to decide which to use in which contexts).

6. We could realize that, since we can now see, with the benefit of hindsight, that we have had blindspots in the past that led us to following something that was less than ideal, it is highly probably that we CURRENTLY also have blindspots and are following something less than ideal... And so we could discard absolutes and finalities or right and wrong, true and false - and we could instead adopt a spectrum of truth (with everything being true to some extent, and some things being more true than others), and we could resolve to do our best with what we believe to be true in any moment, while remaining completely open to being "wrong", and ready at any moment to discard the current for the new.

7. We could fail to consider this matter altogether, and end up "accidentally" using some kind of combination of the above (and/or something else we've missed).

8. Similar to 7, we could declare that there's no point trying to aim for anything (however we arrive at that conclusion).

Now let's run through them, look at them as a whole, and try to make some sense out of this...

NB - before we go any further, let me be clear that it's quite probable that I'm missing something here. If so, please fill me in, and I can adjust it for all of our benefit. These are the biggest questions that mankind has grappled with for millenia, and I'm by no means suggesting that I have all the answers. Just a few ideas and thought experiments.

(Opportunistic - pain vs. pleasure, Socialized - shame vs. pride, Self-authoring** - self-betrayal vs. self-esteem, Self-transformative** - unnecessary vs. unobstructed & connected self-expression)
(Archaic, Magic, Magic-Mythic, Mythic-Literal, Rational, Pluralistic, Integral, Unity...)

(I believe there IS a difference, and an important one at that, between the emotions of #1 and the intuition of #4.)















Footnotes

1 - I remember first seeing it broken down like this a few years ago (in a book I was browsing in an airport WHSmith) called "Feel The Fear and Do It Anyway" by Susan Jeffers, so creds to her.

2 - And not to trip you out too much, but really, before __that__ we need to know, Who is it that's doing the aiming and shooting? And Who is it that's asking these questions? But yeah, more on that later, hehe :)
