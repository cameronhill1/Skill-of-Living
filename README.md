Life is kinda weird, don't you think?

Just the other day, I was remarking to my mum how strange it is, giving the example of frying eggs.

I pointed to the eggs I was frying, and as I cracked another, I said something like:

"I mean, look at this. Inside this fragile little shell (*crack*), it's gooey and transparent. Kinda weird...

... But then it gets weirder. As you cook it, it turns white!"

And then we take that goo and put it in our bellies and make sounds (words) that refer to this process as "eating eggs"...

And we never question any of it.

Meanwhile, we're a bunch of (slightly) more evolved "chimps" (we call ourselves Homo Sapiens, or "_Wise_ Man" in Latin)...

Spinning on a round lump of rock (that we call Earth)...

in a black expanse<sup>0</sup> of mostly-nothingness (that we refer to as "space").

Most of us never really question THAT, either. In fact, we tend not to question things much at all. (At least, considering how weird they are).

And when we _do_ ask questions, they tend to relate to playing the game better (eg. "How can I get X to like me?", or "How can I make more money?"), rather than questioning the game, or even the player ("Who am I?"), themselves.

Instead, we tend to move through life, most of the time, with rigid certainty, holding fast to our opinions on everything from our religion, our politics, and our morality, to our diet, our fashion, and our sense of self.

But how can we be so certain about these topics, when we don't even know what we're doing here?<sup>0.5</sup> We're trying to build completely stable structures on completely unstable foundations.

It's easy to get caught up and lost in the day to day details and monotonies of life in society... and never really look any deeper, never really question the way things are.

So that's the purpose of this site... **To embrace the beautiful mystery of _not knowing_ as a foundation, to rebuild from there with some relatively clear (and somewhat crowdsourced) thinking to find what's most important, and to experiment (together) in finding the best ways to live in alignment with that.**

The particular format that this takes is continually morphing and evolving over time, like its own living being. I have an overall intention, and a few ideas organized into some kind of plan, but we'll see how it unfolds.

```
An example of how this is changing: as I continued writing this, the next section was originally called "Why questions? And what gets in the way?"

Its purpose was to make sure we were moving forward without any lingering doubts, by first playing devil's advocate and questioning the value of questions, and then by exploring what tends to get in the way of us questioning things (and otherwise doing things that we sense might be beneficial for us).

These kinds of sections, where we're double-checking our thinking and handling common objections, are important in what we're doing here... especially considering we're starting by emphasizing the importance of "not knowing" and the value of questions!

However, that section got pretty thorough, long-winded, and began to disrupt the flow completely. So I've put it all on a separate page, and linked it [here](https://skillofliving.com/1-1){:target="_blank"). I will continue to do that, or put them in the footnotes, where relevant. Then you can check them out at your leisure.

Many of the questions you feel arising will be addressed later on, and so you may find that, by simply reading through from start to finish, there is no need for these sections. However, in the event that really just don't get something... they're there (most of the time).

Okay, but with that being said, what else will it look like? What will we be covering? Am I worth listening to?

I'll be concise. At the moment, it's turning into a simple series of 7 articles, covering both theory and practice.

1. X
2. X
3. X
4. X
5. X
6. X
7. X

The idea is that it's 1-a-day, for a week - a "7-day challenge", should you choose to accept it - so we get through the "talk" pretty quickly and get into actually living it.

As for "am I worth listening to"... I don't know. Here are a couple considerations:

1. These ideas are not "mine". I didn't come up with them. I am not *at all* claiming to be a master of any kind. I'm simply playing the role of researcher, experimenter, and connector - a sort of creative scientist. There may be a few new ways of phrasing things, a few new insights... but for the most part, all I'm offering here are my developing skills in: taking the complex and seemingly disparate into the simple and integrated; challenging assumptions, asking quality questions, and reasoning from first principles; and running high-fidelity experiments with a growing sample-size (myself, my clients and friends, other followers of this site) to test our hypotheses and apply our conclusions as well as we can. In other words, all I can really offer *is my ability to learn and live well.*

2. As social beings, we have evolved a bias for taking things at face-value (or "second-hand learning"), rather than thinking for ourselves<sup>1</sup>. Our inclination to believe something in this way is influenced by the *number* of people believing a thing, the *certainty* with which they're saying it, and the relative authority or *status* of those people. Much of our society operates in this way; for example, schools teach our children to *memorize* facts and methods, and teachers often discourage continually asking the "why" question.

This way of operating has been extremely useful, and has arguably been one of the main reasons why we've evolved so rapidly as a species - but it also has weaknesses. On a major scale, it's one explanation for how things like the holocaust happen - blindly following those with conviction in positions of power (and the herd with them). On a smaller scale, I'd suggest that it may be responsible for much of our collective error, ignorance, and accompanying suffering.

Anyways, the point is - try to judge the ideas herein, and anywhere else for that matter, for their own quality, rather than any falsely implied quality from their messenger. Even the best of the best in any field are just people, prone to exactly the same biases and mistakes as the rest of us.

And most importantly, think and test them for yourself. If you find results or evidence that seem to be contrary to anything here, please email me (c@skillofliving.com) and share your findings!

3. With that caveat out the way, I do think there's value in ensuring you only listen to people who are actually living it and seeing results (rather than armchair professors), so here's a little bio:

- Generally a pretty happy, healthy, "present" guy (most important?) 
- Things used to come quite difficult for me - now they come relatively easily
- I've managed to significantly improve every area of my life (eg. health, relationships, finances, sense of meaning + purpose + aliveness + perspective + connection to something large than us)
- I started young - played chess , rugby, singing ... 
- I used to have a tendency to get very addicted to things, whether it was video games, ... 
- Past couple years, ads
- Currently launching a health consulting company (unrelated to any of this)
- I used to have questions like "Why does it seem the more I want something, the less likely it is to happen?" "Why does it feel like there's something in the way, something I'm missing?" "Why does it seem to be so effortless and relatively easy for my friends?" I found some answers that helped me a lot, and I don't really ask those questions anymore.

One more thing - you may wish to drag the url to the bookmark bar for easy access whenever you've finished.

So with all that being said, let's jump right into the fun stuff!

## What do we want, why, and what gets in the way?

Before we can figure out "how" to hit the target (or get close), we first need to know what we're aiming for (or have a good guess, at least).<sup>2</sup>

It appears to me today that there are a few ways we could go about this:

1. We could follow our desires, aversions, and emotions - both those that can be satisfied in the short-term, and those requiring longer-term, more strategic pursuit.

2. We could come up with ideas, stories, and beliefs - based partly on our experiences, and partly on those of others - and follow their conclusions.

3. We could attempt to use reason, rationality, and experimentation to find one or more thing(s) to aim at.

4. We could affirm our direct experience, our intuition, and the sense of "just knowing", and follow that.

5. We could use a combination of the above - perhaps the "rightness" of a method depends on the circumstances and the user (although one method would need to be used to decide which to use in which contexts).

6. We could realize that, since we can now see, with the benefit of hindsight, that we have had blindspots in the past that led us to following something that was less than ideal, it is highly probably that we CURRENTLY also have blindspots and are following something less than ideal... And so we could discard absolutes and finalities of right and wrong, true and false - and we could instead adopt a _spectrum_ of truth (with everything being true to some extent, and some things being more true than others), and we could resolve to do our best with what we believe to be true in any moment, while remaining completely open to being "wrong", and ready at any moment to discard the old for the new.

7. We could fail to consider this matter altogether (either deliberately or unconsciously), and end up "accidentally" using some kind of combination of the above (and/or something else we've missed).

8. Similar to 7, we could declare that there's no point trying to aim for anything (however we arrive at that conclusion).

Now let's run through them, look at them as a whole, and try to make some sense out of this...

*NB - before we go any further, let me be clear that it's quite probable that I'm missing something here. If so, please fill me in, and I can adjust it for all of our benefit. These are questions that mankind has grappled with for millenia, and I'm by no means suggesting that I have all the answers. Just a few ideas and thought experiments.







(Opportunistic - pain vs. pleasure, Socialized - shame vs. pride, Self-authoring** - self-betrayal vs. self-esteem, Self-transformative** - unnecessary vs. unobstructed & connected self-expression)
(Archaic, Magic, Magic-Mythic, Mythic-Literal, Rational, Pluralistic, Integral, Unity...)

(I believe there IS a difference, and an important one at that, between the emotions of #1 and the intuition of #4.)

(NB - 7 is behind the obliviousness consciousness... And partly why consciousness/awareness is important)

(If it’s not obvious what to do, just “be” until it is. ?)

(Stumbling on Happiness, bad at predicting what will make us happy - look at those who are happiest... giving... but not out of obligation, but natural extension of handling your own stuff first, expanding circle of concern, evolution, skills...)










Footnotes

0 - By volume, the Earth is supposedly 5.539108e+82 times smaller than the known universe. And for most of us, most of our daily concerns are not even worldcentric, but "egocentric", and maybe "social-circle-centric". [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy7NzjCmUf0){:target="_blank"} is pretty cool and puts things in perspective.

0.5 - Sure, there's the big bang, or maybe this is a virtual reality, or maybe a God created it... But where could _these_ things have come from in the first place? If you really let yourself ponder this, you can have some pretty deep realizations (or perhaps, un-realizations), and a sense of deep wonder can arise.

0.75 - *note to self*, possibly include a brief overview / current outline here too (and remove menu at the top, apart from Tl;dr, and put it at the end of the series, perhaps)

0.76 - Link to other page with that section

1 - Although it seems to be pretty intuitive to me, if you'd like to look into it a bit more, google "cognitive authority" as a branch of social epistemology.

2 - And not to trip you out too much, but really, before _that_ we need to know, Who is it that's doing the aiming and shooting? And Who is it that's asking these questions? But yeah, more on that later. Hehe :)





****


In 2, with the paradoxes, can mention how we pointed before to the essential nature of dealing with them - both, a spectrum, transcend and include, both true, one is more... 



Core idea of having evolutionary programming that helps us in short-term/survival situations, but as we expand our perspective (like from I to We / Opportunistic to Socialised, so too from we to all / life, etc.), our adaptability comes down to our ability to identify the best ways to rewrite our own code/programming and to quickly do it. Eg. avoidance to stillness (with some grey area too), and from I/We to All/Life... 
Whether it's through methods we explore that are now available, or possibilities in the future like HI...
